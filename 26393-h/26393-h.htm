<p>This translation was undertaken with the especial object of facilitating the study of the native medicinal plants by the numerous
medical officers stationed at small posts throughout the Philippines. In order to aid in the recognition of these plants,
the botanical descriptions have been revised to the extent of adding, where possible, the size and shape of the plant, English
name, length of leaves, color of flowers, etc., in many instances supplying the entire botanical description where it had
been omitted on account of general familiarity with the plant. Comparing the few analyses that I have had an opportunity to
make with corresponding ones in the native works from which Dr. Tavera has taken his botanical descriptions, I am impressed
with the necessity for a revision of the Botany of the Philippines. However, as the therapeutic properties of the flora are
of foremost interest to the medical profession I have not hesitated to publish the book in its present form as an entering
wedge, leaving to those better fitted the great work of classifying the flora of these islands in accordance with modern botanical
science.

</p>
<p>Dr. Tavera has faithfully described the Malay and Hindu therapeutics of the present day, enriching his description by observations
founded on a long practice in Paris and in his own native Luzon. From this potpourri of scientific therapeutics and ignorant,
superstitious drugging the interested physician will elicit not a few useful data concerning the treatment of disease in the
tropics, and at the same time gain a more intimate knowledge of both the people and plants of our new Asiatic possessions.

</p>
<p>I take this occasion to gratefully acknowledge my obligations to Mr. A. P. Tonielli, stenographer and translator of the Supreme
Court of the Philippines, for typewriting the manuscript of this translation.

</span><h2 class="normal">Preface.</h2>
<p>Commissioned by His Majesty&#8217;s Government to study the medicinal plants of my native country, I returned there and spent two
years in collecting data regarding the use that the Filipinos make of their plants in the treatment of disease. At the same
time I collected and carefully preserved some with the purpose of taking them to Europe, to study their chemical composition
in the laboratories of Paris under the direction of the eminent men who had been my instructors in medicine.

</p>
<p>The work I did in the Philippines was preliminary, a preparation for the more extended study of the subject which I wished
to make in Paris, where I went with my notes and collection. Unfortunately, upon leaving Manila, I confided the mounting and
pressing of my plants to an inexperienced person who stupidly placed in the midst of them several succulent tubers which decomposed
during the voyage and spoiled the other plants. At the same time I received in Paris an important collection of the vegetable
drugs of the Philippines, sent by my friend the pharmacist, M. Rosedo Garcia, and destined for the World&#8217;s Fair of 1889. I
opened with great pleasure the wood and zinc box in which the collection came, anticipating that I should be able to carry
out my plan of study and at the same time win for my friend, Garcia, a well-deserved premium. Imagine my disappointment upon
finding that, by an unfortunate coincidence, his plants had arrived in the same condition as mine, having also been packed
with tubers of ubi, gabi, etc., and several cocoanuts which had decomposed.

</p>
<p>Many times since then I have tried to obtain from Manila, through exchange or payment of money, a similar collection, but
have been unable to secure a single leaf of the plants I so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e199" href="#xd0e199">viii</a>]</span>desired. If in the future I have the good fortune to procure any, I shall make a study of those at hand and publish the results.

</p>
<p>I herewith publish the results of my investigations and experiments in Manila, where, especially in the neighboring towns
of San Mateo and San Miguel, I often had opportunities for using, with good results, the plants of which this volume treats.
I may add that in spite of the limited means at my disposal in Manila and the short time left me by my regular occupations
I was able to conduct a few laboratory experiments owing to which this work contains some personal observations reinforcing
those quoted from medical literature.

</p>
<p>The flora of the Archipelago is known to-day through the works of Fathers Blanco, Llanos, Fernandez del Villar and Naves,
and of the engineers Jordano, the brothers Vidal and Soler and others who have brought such honor to Spanish science, preparing
the way for the study of the therapeutic and industrial applications of that wonderfully rich plant life with which our islands
have been endowed. Their works help us to recognize the plants whose medicinal virtues are herein described and it is to them
I owe the botanical descriptions in this treatise.

</p>
<p>Father Blanco, in describing certain plants, mentions their medicinal uses in the Philippines, but his descriptions are few
and very deficient as one would expect in a work of the scope of his Flora. A Jesuit of some reputation, Father Clain, published
in Manila in 1712 a book entitled &#8220;<span lang="es">Remedios f&aacute;ciles para diferentes enfermedades?</span>&#8221; in which he speaks of the medicinal virtues of some of the indigenous plants, almost the same ones that appear in another
work, a frank and pleasing little treatise written by Father Santa Maria. Father Mercado is the only one who has written a
special treatise on the subject and his manuscript remained unedited until the Augustinian Fathers of Manila published it
in the last edition of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e210" href="#xd0e210">ix</a>]</span>Father Blanco&#8217;s &#8220;Flora&#8221;; but neither this work nor those of Clain or Santa Maria are useful to a physician, nor are they as
accurately written as works of a scientific character should be. From time to time superficial articles have appeared in the
Manila papers regarding the virtues of some plant or other and these books and articles comprise the whole literature on the
subject up to this time.

</p>
<p>Some physicians regard with small favor the therapeutic application of plants by the Filipino &#8220;herb-doctors&#8221; (<span lang="es">curanderos</span>) as being entirely empirical. This disparagement is unjustified because in all the most rational and scientific remedies
that we make use of, the first step towards the final development of their relative position among remedies is due to empiricism
which is founded on daily experience, on observation of results obtained in specific cases, facts that are handed down from
father to son for generations. The scientific explanation is lacking, but those first ideas frequently owing their origin
to chance, or, perhaps, to superstition, have often been based upon the observation of facts which, although fortuitous, are
none the less positive.

</p>
<p>Many of the plants mentioned in this book are official in the Pharmacop&#339;ia of India and we see no reason why their use should
be proscribed in the Philippines. Filipino physicians not only can but should employ many indigenous plants in their therapeutics;
in many instances they would find them more useful than the exotics, which are not always fresh and are commonly reduced in
strength by long keeping or damaged by some circumstance of voyage or climate. The price is another argument in favor of the
use of native drugs. If the pharmacists would prepare extracts and keep on hand the crude drugs most in demand the public
would gain a great advantage and the druggists be well repaid for their labor. Physicians and pharmacists will surely understand
these advantages and when finally one considers that the patients generally prefer to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e219" href="#xd0e219">x</a>]</span>treated with native plants, I feel justified in the hope that their use will spread rapidly in the Philippines.

</p>
<p>To employ therapeutically the drugs described in this work is not to experiment &#8220;<span lang="la">in anima vilis</span>,&#8221; as some would have us believe. To experiment is to employ unknown remedies of unknown virtues and properties.

</p>
<p>In this treatise I am not attempting to fix the indications for this or that product, but simply make known the diseases in
which the Filipinos and the natives of other countries employ the products. Any physician has a perfect right to prescribe
these drugs, as have also the &#8220;curanderos&#8221; and even the laity, with this difference, however, that the physician is capable
of observing results and guiding himself by the physiologic action of the drugs. His knowledge of the physiologic and anatomo-pathologic
problems of the human body, will enable the physician to make scientific inferences that would be hidden from the common &#8220;<span lang="es">curandero</span>.&#8221;

</p>
<p>As neither the Manila nor the provincial physicians keep these medicinal plants in stock, with the exception of those that
are official in the European and American pharmacop&#339;ias, it will be necessary for the physician who wishes to use them, to
busy himself with seeking them and laying in a sufficient stock to serve him when the opportunity presents itself. It is necessary
to preserve them by drying and this is best done by exposing them several days to the fresh air in a dry place&#8212;for example,
the corridors of the house&#8212;being careful not to expose them to the rays of the sun, in which latter event the fleshy and juicy
plants which do not desiccate rapidly, putrefy or ferment.

</p>
<p>A convenient way to get them is to visit the Binondo Square where there has been market for native drugs from time immemorial.
The gardeners from the neighboring towns, especially those from Pasay and Singalon, regularly offer the plants for sale and
will undertake to supply you with any that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e235" href="#xd0e235">xi</a>]</span>may not be on hand. Inasmuch as the common names of the plants lead to many mistakes and much confusion, it is indispensable
to acquaint one&#8217;s self with the description of the plant and be sure that the actual product conforms in all respects to the
description. For this purpose it is well to obtain flowering specimens, and bearing this fact in mind I have been careful
to indicate the flowering season of each plant. By making excursions to the towns of San Mateo and Angono I have obtained
an abundance of whatever I sought and at the same time have learned by talking with the mountaineers and &#8220;<span lang="es">curanderos</span>,&#8221; what uses they make of their plants. The &#8220;<span lang="es">curanderos</span>&#8221; know a great deal concerning these uses, but become very reticent as soon as they are questioned about them. Whether it
is dread of ridicule or selfishness or fear that silences them, the fact remains that it is no easy matter to glean any useful
facts from them. And yet by tact and friendliness one may elicit much more information from them than first impressions would
lead one to hope.

</p>
<p>Leaves should be gathered when fully developed, rejecting the old, dried and worm-eaten ones.

</p>
<p>The best time to gather bark is one month before the period of inflorescence, when it is rich in sap. The flowers are best
gathered when about half expanded. The fruit is gathered green or ripe according to the active principle sought. The seeds
should always be mature.

</p>
<p>Not all parts of the plant are equally provided with the active principle which may be localized in the root or the flower;
or distinct principles may exist in different parts of the same plant. Therefore the part indicated, and only that part, should
be employed.

</p>
<p>In the root the active substance usually resides in the bark, sometimes in the parenchyma that envelopes the woody tissue
and rarely in the woody tissue itself, as, for example, in &#8220;rhubarb&#8221; and &#8220;pareira brava.&#8221;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd0e251" href="#xd0e251">xii</a>]</span></p>
<p>The stem bark is also a frequent seat of the active principle, of which the outer portion contains the greater amount, according
to the valuable experiments of Howard.

</p>
<p>Some plants owe their therapeutic importance to their wood, others to their leaves or flowers, and regarding the localization
of the active principle in these parts we have nothing especial to indicate. The fruit, however, may have a pericarp consisting
of mucilage, starch, sugar and gum, etc., while the seeds contain fatty matter, fixed or essential oils or alkaloids, as is
the case with coffee and cacao. In view of these facts, we repeat that it is indispensable to use that part of each plant
which I have indicated as applicable to a determined case or condition.

</p>
<p>I earnestly hope that the physicians and pharmacists practising in the Philippines may undertake investigations and experiments
regarding the therapeutic properties of the plants of my native land, and that my endeavors may have acted as a stimulus or
inspiration to the loyal and earnest study of the subjects that are now awakening such interest, not only in Europe and America,
but in India and Japan.

</p>
<p>I should be pleased to receive notes, plants or reports of researches from any one interested in the subject matter of this
book, and I shall consider it a pleasure, as well as a duty, to devote my forces, small as they may be, to aiding any one
who may do me the honor to claim my assistance.

dialects I have demonstrated to be the easiest, most rational and convenient. I should be inconsistent as to my own theories

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Nom. Vulg.</span>&#8212;<i>Malakatm&oacute;n</i>, Tag.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The wood of <i>malakatm&oacute;n</i> is one of the best known and popular drugs of the Binondo<a class="noteref" id="xd0e1121src" href="#xd0e1121">1</a> market place. It is used as an infusion internally in the h&aelig;moptysis of consumptives, and externally in the treatment of
sore throat, its action being due to the large amount of tannin it contains. It is also employed in Malabar in the form of
an infusion of the leaves of the species, <i>T. Rheedi</i>, to treat sore throat, mixing it with a decoction of rice called <i>cange</i>.

</p>
<p>The Filipinos do not distinguish this species from the <i>T. Assa</i>.

</p>
<p>Both are called <i>malakatm&oacute;n</i>, and are employed indiscriminately to accomplish the same results. The silicious concretion obtained from the leaves is used
as a polish in the form of polish paper.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Dose.</span>&#8212;In infusion for internal use, 4 grams of wood to 1 liter of water; as a gargle, 10 to 15 grams to the liter.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Botanical Description.</span>&#8212;A shrub with leaves alternate, oval, serrate, finely dentate with very short and stiff hairs. Flowers of a strong, rather
agreeable odor, axillary, in panicles. Calyx, 4 sepals. Corolla, 4 petals. Stamens indefinite, expanding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>at the upper end and bearing 2 anthers. Carpels 3, with ovules indefinite in two series. Seeds with red arils.

<p><b>Illicium anisatum, L.</b>

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Nom. Vulg.</span>&#8212;<i>Anis estrellado</i>, <i>Badiana</i>, Sp.; <i>Sag&#771;ki</i>, Tag.; <i>Star Anise</i>, Eng.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;Although this plant does not grow in the Philippines, the use of its fruit is so common there that it demands a place in
this work. It is employed chiefly as a condiment in the preparation of food, and its essential oil is used to prepare the
native &#8220;anise cordial&#8221; by mixing it with alcohol obtained from the palm or from sugar cane.

</p>
<p>The decoction of the fruit is given after meals as a tea-like beverage, to aid digestion or for its carminative effect in
flatulent colic.

</p>
<p>Star anise has an aromatic taste, slightly bitter and acrid, and a very marked perfume of anise which with its star-like form
gives the plant one of its names. It is a very useful stimulant, tonic, stomachic and carminative.

</p>
<p>It is official in all Pharmacop&#339;ias and the pericarp is the part employed.

</p>
<p>The dose is from 1 to 2 grams to 100 of water in infusion, to be taken in one draught.

</p>
<p>According to Schlegel it contains the following substances: An essential oil 4.675; a green waxy material which melts at 51&deg;,
a resin, a gum and saponin. The essential oil is (almost) identical with that of anise from which it is impossible to distinguish

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19">19</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Botanical Description.</span>&#8212;The plant grows in the mountains of Yunnan, China, and in Tonquin. The part used in the Philippines is the fruit, being indeed
the only part known here. This is composed of 8 woody follicles arranged about a central column in the form of a star. These
follicles open at maturity and reveal the seeds, which are shining, smooth, ovoid, hard, of a pretty chestnut-red color. In
the Philippines they are sold even in the smallest food-vending shops.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;Makabuhay is one of the most widely known and used plants in the Philippines; a sort of panacea applied to all bodily afflictions.
Its Tagalo name means literally &#8220;you may live.&#8221; A shoot deprived of roots and dropped in some moist place is soon covered
with bright green leaves and adventitious roots. This peculiarity of the plant made it possible for me to take a large number
of sprouts from Manila to Paris where they arrived perfectly fresh after a voyage of forty days, during which they lay almost
forgotten in the ship and the cars.

</p>
<p>The stem is the part employed in medicine. A decoction is given internally in the various forms of malarial fever and of dyspepsia.

<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;One of the uses to which the India berries (<i>Cocas de Levante</i>) are put in the Philippines, is to throw them into small sluggish streams or into lakes with the object of intoxicating the
fish which soon come to the surface and float there as if dead. This custom is very extensive in Malaysia, in India and even
in Europe, where, in order to avoid the cases of poisoning which this practice has occasioned in the consumers of fish taken
in this way, it has been found necessary to forbid the sale of the berries except in the pharmacies. These restrictions are
practiced in France.

</p>
<p>In the Binondo market in Manila the root of this plant may be found in abundance; it is yellow and very bitter. The natives
use the infusion (5&#8211;10 grams to 300 cc. of water) in fevers, dyspepsia and menstrual derangements. In India also the root
is used in the same complaints.

</p>
<p>The fruit contains the highly toxic principle <i>picrotoxin</i>, and others as follows:

</p>
<p><i>Menispermin</i> (C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>24</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is an alkaloid which crystallizes in pyramidal prisms, is soluble in alcohol and ether and insoluble in water. Hot nitric
acid converts it into oxalic acid and a yellow substance of a resinous appearance.

</p>
<p><i>Picrotoxin</i> (C<sub>30</sub>H<sub>24</sub>O<sub>13</sub>) is not an alkaloid as may be seen from its formula. Its properties are not well known at the present time. It crystallizes
in small quadrilateral prisms, white and transparent, or in needles grouped in stars. No odor, taste bitter, insoluble in
water, partly soluble in alcohol and in ether, freely soluble in acids and alkalies. A solution in concentrated sulphuric
acid has a saffron-yellow color. Nitric acid transforms it into oxalic acid.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25">25</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Picrotoxinin</i> exists in picrotoxin in the proportion of 32 to 100, and may be separated by boiling in benzine. It is bitter, poisonous,
reduced by Fehling&#8217;s solution and nitrate of silver. Sixty-six per cent. of <i>picrotoxin</i> consists of another bitter substance, non-poisonous&#8212;<i>picrotin</i>, which is insoluble in benzine and is reduced by Fehling&#8217;s solution and nitrate of silver. Lastly, <i>anamirtin</i> is found in the mother water of picrotoxin; it is not bitter, not poisonous, and not reducible by the aforementioned reagents.

</p>
<p>The fruit of the <i>anamirta</i>, the &#8220;coca de Levante&#8221; is an acrid, narcotic poison, which may not be employed internally; its uses are limited to external
medication. In the Pharmacop&#339;ia of India is given the formula for a parasiticide ointment, highly recommended in the treatment

</p>
<p>The negros of Senegal use the decoction of the root to cure gonorrh&#339;a. The milky juice to which Blanco refers is used in different
countries to treat various skin diseases, including the cutaneous manifestations of syphilis and leprosy; to remove warts,
and as an eye wash in catarrhal conjunctivitis.

</p>
<p>The English physicians of India state that it is dangerous to use the milky juice as an application to the eye, although Dymock
claims the contrary.

</p>
<p>The flowers are narcotic by virtue of a principle resembling morphine, perhaps identical with that alkaloid.

</p>
<p>The seeds yield a fixed oil on expression, which is laxative and relieves the pains of colic, probably by virtue of its narcotic
properties. Physicians in India praise this oil highly; not only is it a sure and painless purgative, but it is free from
the viscidity and disgusting taste of castor-oil; besides it has the advantage of operating in small doses, 2&#8211;4 grams. Its
activity is proportionate to its freshness. Dr. W. O&#8217;Shaughnessy does not value this oil highly, but the experience of many
distinguished physicians of India has proved the purgative and other properties that have just been mentioned. Possibly the
differences of opinion may arise from the fact that oils from different plants were used in the trials.

</p>
<p>The seeds yield a fixed oil, yellow, clear, of sweet taste, density 0.919 at 15&deg;; it remains liquid at &#8211;5&deg;; is soluble in

is the narcotic principle possessed by this plant, which is not hard to believe when one considers the family to which it

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The principal use of the seeds is in cookery and everybody knows the yellow color which Filipino cooks impart to almost all
their dishes. In medicine the fine powder that covers the seeds is used as a h&aelig;mostatic and internally as a stomachic. On
account of the astringent qualities of the coloring matter it is used in some countries to treat dysentery, a fact which suggests
its possible therapeutic or rather hygienic usefulness as a condiment. It seems to effect a cure in dysentery in the same
manner as ipecac.

</p>
<p>In India, Brazil and the Antilles the natives make a sort of paste of achuete known under the name of <i>rocu</i>.

<p>An analysis of mangosteen peel by W. Schmidt demonstrated a large quantity of tannin, a resin and a crystallizable principle
named <i>mangostin</i> (C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>23</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) which exists in the form of fine, golden yellow lamin&aelig;, tasteless, soluble in alcohol, ether and the alkalies, insoluble
in water. With the perchloride of iron it gives a blackish-green color, and sulphuric acid colors it red.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The fruit of the second species, the true name of which is <i>binucaw</i>, is acid and edible. The fruit and the trunk of both species, when cut, exude a gum-resin very much like gamboge which is
obtained from the <i>G. morella</i> or <i>G. pedicellata</i>, Desr. These gum-resins, however, seem to be much inferior to gamboge; they contain an essential oil which does not exist
in the latter and their color is paler.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Botanical Description.</span>&#8212;The <i>G. venulosa</i> is a tree with leaves opposite, lanceolate, acute, entire and glabrous, the inferior surface covered with nervelets which
converge at the apex. Petioles short and flattened. Flowers tetramerous. Calyx, 4 persistent sepals. Corolla, 4 petals, overlapping,
fleshy, ovate, of the same color as the calyx. Stamens numerous; no filaments; anthers round and very small. Style very short
and thick, stigma peltate, divided into 10 parts. Fruit globose, depressed, no well-marked ridges when ripe.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Nom. Vulg.</span>&#8212;I do not know the name given by the Filipinos to this tree, which Vidal and Soler have seen in Montalv&aacute;n, Tiwi (Albay) and
San Mateo (Province of Manila); but it is highly important in medicine as the true gamboge is obtained from it. <i>Gamboge Tree</i>, Eng.

</p>
<p>The Gamboge of the U. S. P. and B. P. is obtained from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37">37</a>]</span><i>G. Hanburii</i> which differs somewhat botanically from <i>G. morella</i>.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;All parts of the plant contain a thick, yellow, milky juice which constitutes the gamboge. In Malabar, Ceylon, Canara and
Singapore the following method of extraction is followed: At the beginning of the rainy season a spiral incision is made around
the bark of about half the tree trunk, and a piece of bamboo is fixed in place to collect the juice which slowly exudes from
the cut for several months, soon becoming viscid and then solid after contact with the air. One tree, as a rule, yields enough
sap to fill three internodal segments of bamboo, each 50 cm. long by 3&#8211;5 cm. in diameter.

</p>
<p>Gamboge is a laxative in doses of 10&#8211;15 cgm., produces abundant evacuations with violent colicky pains in doses of 30&#8211;50 cgm.,
and is an irritant poison in large doses. In other words it is a highly energetic hydragogue cathartic, especially indicated
when we wish to drain off the fluid element of the blood, as in dropsy, asthma, pulmonary and cerebral congestion. It is also
used as a vermifuge.

</p>
<p>It is rarely given alone, but is combined with calomel, aloes, jalap, rhubarb, etc.

<p>In Burmah they extract the balsam by the following method: A large hole is cut in the trunk of the tree and a fire is built
in this cavity and kept up till the wood of the trunk begins to burn, by which time the oleo resin has collected in abundance
in the segments of bamboo placed to receive it. When the exudate diminishes, fire is again placed in the cavity and one tree
may tolerate 2, 3 or even 4 of these cavities. The exudate on standing separates into 2 parts; a solid called &#8220;guad&#8221; which
forms the lower layer, and a supernatant liquid which is the balsam. It is dense, viscid and very fluorescent; opaque and
gray-green by reflected light. It has an odor similar to that of copaiba, is bitter and aromatic. Its density is 0.964. It
is soluble in benzine, in bisulphuret of carbon, chloroform, the essential oils and less so in ether and acetic acid. It becomes
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>turbid and coagulates if it be kept at 100&deg; for some time and it solidifies at 200&deg;, while copaiba remains liquid at this
temperature.

</p>
<p>A specimen of the balsam examined by Fl&uuml;ckiger consisted of 54.44 parts semifluid resin and 45.56 volatile material. Upon
distillation it yields an essential oil, of slight odor, straw-colored; formula C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>32</sub> (Werner). If purified its density is 0.915. It is soluble in amylic alcohol, scarcely so in absolute alcohol. Hydrochloric
acid colors it a beautiful blue. The resin remaining after distillation, dissolved in alcohol 0.838 with the addition of ammonia,
yields as a precipitate a crystalline acid (gurjunic acid), C<sub>44</sub>H<sub>64</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, soluble in alcohol 0.838, in ether, in benzol and bisulphide of carbon. It melts at 220&deg; (Werner), solidifies at 180&deg; and
is decomposed at 260&deg;.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The root bark is antiasthmatic, emmenagogue, and according to Daruty<a class="noteref" id="xd0e2961src" href="#xd0e2961">4</a> is a substitute for ergot in uterine hemorrhage. The leaves are used in bronchial troubles and the seeds are sudorific. The
negroes in the United States use the root bark in large doses as an abortifacient; but a dose of 60 grams to 1,200 of water
in decoction is proper and useful in treating dysmenorrh&#339;a.

</p>
<p>For a long time the seeds went to waste but industry has learned to obtain from them a brownish-red oil which is used as a
substitute for olive oil, from which it is hard to distinguish it, if the latter is adulterated by mixing the two; for both
have the same density and a very similar odor and taste. For this reason the production of cottonseed oil is very considerable
nowadays. It is cheap and excellent for domestic, industrial and pharmaceutic use.

</p>
<p>The seeds are used in North America in dysentery and as a galactagogue, and the juice of the leaves as an emollient in diarrh&#339;a
and mild dysentery. The pulp of the seeds, after the oil is extracted, yields a sweet material called <i>gossypose</i>, which is dextrogyrous and has the formula C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>32</sub>O<sub>16</sub> + 5H<sub>2</sub>O.

</p>
<p>The cotton itself, the part used in commerce as a textile, is also the portion of the plant most widely employed in therapeutics;
not only the fiber from this species is used, but also that of others that grow in the Philippines, the <i>G. Barbadense</i>, L. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>(nom. vulg. <i>Pernambuko</i>, Tag.), and the <i>G. arboreum</i>, L. (<i>Bulak na bundok</i>, <i>Bulak na totoo</i>, Tag.).

</p>
<p>Cotton is used extensively in bacteriological laboratories as a filter of liquids and gases. This property possessed by cotton,
of retaining in its fibers the germs of the air was utilized by the famous French surgeon Gu&eacute;rin in the treatment that bears
his name. The denuded surfaces exposed to infection by airborne bacteria are completely protected against them when, according
to the Gu&eacute;rin treatment, they are enveloped in large masses of fresh, raw cotton, presumably free from micro&ouml;rganisms. To
avoid the possibility of infection by the cotton itself, it is now the practice to sterilize it either by means of chemicals
such as carbolic acid, iodoform, etc., or by physical means such as high temperatures.

</p>
<p>Raw cotton is used in compounding gun cotton or explosive cotton, also named <i>pyroxylin</i>, and this is used to make collodion, so extensively employed in medicine.

</p>
<p>Pyroxylin is made by treating cotton with equal parts of nitric and sulphuric acids, then washing with water till the latter
ceases to give a precipitate with chloride of baryta; then dry in the air.

</p>
<p>Collodion is made by dissolving 5 grams of pyroxylin in the following mixture:

all in medicine, which is usually the case with those plants to which they have given no name. In India the peculiar spiral
form of the fruit has suggested its application, according to the theories of the doctrine of symbolism. Ainslie says that
the Hindoos use it to treat diseases of the external auditory canal. On account of its emollient properties and probably on
account of its twisted form, it is used internally as a decoction, in flatulence and the intestinal colic of children. It
is indispensable in the marriage ceremonies of the caste of Vaisya, among whom it is customary for the groom to wear on his
wrists in the form of bracelets, strings of this fruit combined with that of <i>Randia dumetorum</i>.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Nom. Vulg.</span>&#8212;<i>Cacao.</i>

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The roasted bean ground with sugar constitutes chocolate, one of the most generally used foods of the Philippines.

</p>
<p>It is very nutritious by virtue of the fat and sugar it contains, but all stomachs do not bear it well and its use is the
unsuspected cause of much dyspepsia. The custom of drinking it very hot and following with a large quantity of cold water
is a very common cause of dilatation of the stomach in the Philippines. The seed of the cacao contains several substances:
cacao butter, albumin, theobromine, starch, glucose, gum, tartaric acid, free or combined, tannin, and mineral substances.
Of these the butter and theobromine are the most important.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>Theobromine (C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>8</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is a weak alkaloid, crystalline, slightly bitter, slightly soluble in cold water, more soluble in hot water, less soluble
in alcohol and ether; stable in the air up to 100&deg;; sublimes without decomposition at 290&deg; in microscopic crystals of the
form of rhomboid prisms ending in an octohedric point (Keller).

</p>
<p>This alkaloid is very little used in therapeutics and its physiological action is said to be analogous to that of caffeine
but weaker. It is better to use the salt of the alkaloid, and that most frequently employed is the salicylate of soda and
theobromine in doses of from 2 to 6 grams daily in solution or pill. Lately, however, Dr. Gram has maintained that theobromine
is a powerful diuretic operating when other diuretics fail and further that this effect is produced without injuring the heart.
The double salt is non-toxic, though sometimes in exceedingly weak patients it produces vertigo. Dr. Gram administers 6 grams
a day in one-gram doses.

</p>
<p>Cacao butter is a white substance, slightly yellowish, unctuous to the touch, brittle; with the agreeable odor peculiar to
cacao, and a sweet and pleasant taste. Its density is 0.961, it melts at 30&deg;&#8211;33&deg;, and solidifies at 25&deg;. It dissolves in 20
parts of boiling alcohol, in 100 parts of cold alcohol and in twice its weight of benzin. Cacao butter is obtained by grinding
or mashing the roasted seeds in a hot apparatus and mixing the mass with a fifth or tenth of its weight of boiling water.
It is then pressed between two hot iron plates and the butter thus obtained is refined by boiling water. It is then put aside
in earthen pans, or still better, in moulds, where it solidifies. It does not easily become rancid and, for this reason, enters
into the composition of many ointments and pomades, or is used alone. It serves as the base for suppositories and is, finally,
a highly valued cosmetic. A common substitute is made by mixing oil of almonds, wax and animal fat.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses</span>.&#8212;The part of the plant used in medicine is the leaf which is acid by virtue of the potassium oxalate which it contains. The
decoction is used internally as an antipyretic in fevers and in dysentery. Mistaking the properties of the plant it is given
for vesical calculus which, if composed of oxalates, would be increased instead of diminished by the treatment. In fact the
salt of sorrel in the leaves contains a large quantity of oxalic acid mixed with potassium oxalate. In China, India and the
Philippines the entire plant is used as an antiscorbutic.

</p>
<p>The cold infusion of the leaves is given internally in doses of from 30 to 60 grams, but it is not a medicine to be given
indiscriminately, because in addition to its power of adding to the bulk of calculi of the oxalates, the contained potassium
oxalate is poisonous in doses of 25 to 30 grams. If a concentrated solution is taken, it operates as a corrosive poison, producing
violent pains in the stomach, vomiting, faintness and great weakness. If the solution is dilute its absorption is rapid and
it operates very energetically. When a patient is poisoned by a concentrated solution, the stomach-pump is contraindicated,
because the mucous membrane of the organ is corroded and ulcerated; if by a dilute solution, use the pump to remove as much
of the poison as possible. The best antidote is a watery solution of a soluble salt of lime, <i>i. e.</i>, the saccharate, which forms an insoluble salt with oxalic acid.

</p>
<p>The juice of the leaves is an antidote for the <i>Datura</i> (Stramonium). In India they make a decoction of the plant, mix <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>it with onion juice and apply it to the head as a fomentation in hemicrania.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Nom. Vulg</span>.&#8212;<i>Bilimbin</i>, <i>Balimbin</i>, Tag.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses</span>.&#8212;The common name of this tree, whose fruit is so common, causes it to be confused with the name which Linn&aelig;us gives to the
former species. Balimbin is a fruit of an acid taste, agreeable when ripe, serving the same uses for food as the camia. Its
acidity is due to the presence of oxalic acid, which makes the green fruit useful for removing ink and rust stains from clothes.
The juice of the fruit is refreshing and is given internally mixed with water and sugar as a refreshing drink in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>fevers and as an antiscorbutic. For the latter the ripe fruit is eaten uncooked.

</p>
<p>In Mauritius the juice is used to treat dysentery and hepatitis. Padre Blanco says that the natives use a decoction of camias
and unthreshed rice in diarrh&#339;a and bilious colic. In connection with the subject of camias and balimbins we should mention
the fruit treatment of the bilious diarrh&#339;a of the tropics, spoken of by the French physicians of Cochin China. Dr. Van der
Burg of the Dutch Indies also strongly recommends the treatment of diarrh&#339;a by fruits; in temperate regions using fruits like
peaches, pears, etc., and in the tropics, lychies, mangosteens, etc. In regard to the mangosteens we must not forget that,
while the bark is given because of the amount of tannin it contains, the composition of the pulp is very different. The fruit
acids seem to exercise great influence in the cure of this obstinate disease and I do not hesitate to recommend for this purpose
the camia and the ripe balimbin.

</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Nom. Vulg</span>.&#8212;<i>Rudu</i>, Sp.; <i>Rue</i>, Eng.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses</span>.&#8212;The rue of the European, American and Indian pharmacop&#339;ias is emmenagogue, antispasmodic, anthelmintic, excitant, diaphoretic,
antiseptic and abortive. It contains an essential oil, and rutinic acid (C<sub>25</sub>H<sub>28</sub>O<sub>15</sub>, Borntrager), starch, gum, etc. The essential oil is greenish-yellow, thick, acrid and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>bitter; specific gravity 0.911. It boils at 228&deg;, is slightly soluble in water, and soluble in absolute alcohol. It is promptly
oxidized by nitric acid, and is converted into pelargonic acid and other fatty acids.

</p>
<p>Rutin (or rutinic acid), according to Weiss, is a glucoside which exists in the form of fine needles, bright yellow in color.
It is slightly soluble in cold water and more so in boiling water. It melts at 190&deg;, and solidifies at freezing point, forming
a resinous mass. Its physiological properties are as yet unknown. The part of the plant employed is the leaves, which owe
their property, apparently, to the essential oil they contain, from which they also derive their strong and disagreeable odor
and their bitter, acrid and nauseous taste.

</p>
<p>It is used principally as a uterine stimulant or emmenagogue, for which purpose it is given in doses of 0.10&#8211;0.15 centigrams
of the freshly powdered leaf and 0.05&#8211;0.10 centigrams of the fresh leaves infused in a liter of water. The dry powder of the
leaf should not be used because the essential oil volatilizes and a large proportion of it is lost, which is the most active
principle of the drug. It is an agent which should be prescribed with the greatest prudence for large doses are poisonous
even to the point of causing death. The symptoms following such doses are colic, vomiting, bloody diarrh&#339;a and tenesmus.

</p>
<p>It is also used as an antihemorrhagic after childbirth, but its action is slow, not being felt for several hours after the
administration of the drug; for this reason it cannot take the place of ergot, though it seems to be superior to the latter
in passive hemorrhages. The essential oil is given internally in doses of 2&#8211;6 drops on a piece of sugar. It is sometimes used
as an antispasmodic in hysteria, epilepsy and chorea.

</p>
<p>The Chinese make extensive use of this drug and it is one of their principal abortives. In Hindostan the dried leaves are
burnt and the smoke inhaled as a cure for catarrh in children. They are careful not to administer it to pregnant women.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The leaves are stimulant and astringent, and are used in infusion (15 grams, to water one liter) to treat diarrhea and dysentery.
The root and trunk barks are used for the same treatment and they as well as the leaves owe their properties to an essential
oil and a bitter principle present in all parts of the plant. Vry has demonstrated the presence of a glucoside which he has
named <i>murrayin</i> (C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>10</sub>); it crystallizes in small, white needles, is slightly bitter, soluble in hot water and alcohol, insoluble in ether, slightly
soluble in cold water. It melts at 170&deg;, and dissolves in alkaline solutions coloring them green. Boiled in dilute acids it
splits into <i>murrayetin</i> and glucose. <i>Murrayetin</i> (C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>10</sub>) crystallizes in white needles, inodorous, tasteless, slightly soluble in cold water and in ether, soluble in hot water and
alcohol. Heat destroys its green color in solutions; alkalies, in the presence of cold, increase it. The leaves and the bark
of the plant contain an essential oil.

<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses</span>.&#8212;The essence (essential oil) and juice of the fruit are the parts of the plant used in therapeutics. The essence extracted
from the rind is yellow, fragrant, slightly bitter; density, 0.856; boiling point 165&deg;. The juice which is turbid and pale
yellow in color contains 9% citric acid, 3&#8211;5% gum and sugar and 2&#8211;8/10% inorganic salts. The essence is used to flavor certain
pharmaceutical preparations, and is a diffusible stimulant which may be given internally in doses of 3&#8211;6 drops on a little
sugar. The bitter rind is occasionally used in infusion as a stomachic and stimulant. The juice is most commonly used in lemonade,
a cooling drink which, used intemperately in the Philippines, is apt to cause gastro-intestinal trouble, so commonly attributed
to &#8220;irritation,&#8221; but really the result of a general atony of the digestive organs. Lemon juice is also used with very good
results as a local cleansing application for sore throat, as well as externally on fetid ulcers. In some forms of malarial
fever it seems to have given satisfactory results, administered internally.

</p>
<p>In many navies lemon juice forms a part of the sea ration as a preventive of scurvy, upon which it exercises a real and noteworthy
action. The Danish navy adopted it for this purpose in 1770, the English navy followed, then the French and possibly others.
The English call it lime-juice, and its preventive <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>dose is 30&#8211;40 grams a day. Its curative dose is 100&#8211;150 grams a day. To preserve the lime-juice it was bottled with a layer
of oil, which, floating on the surface kept it from contact with the air; but this process gave it a bad taste as did also
the addition of sulphate of calcium, and at present the English add, to each liter of juice, 60 grams of alcohol, which preserves
it perfectly. Fonssagrives says that the antiscorbutic action of lemon juice is due rather to the vegetable juice itself than
to the citric acid which it contains.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;We do not know the medicinal use of this plant in the Philippines. Probably it has none, but we may give those of the species.
<i>R. marmelos</i>, Cor., the fruit of which is almost identical with that of our species and is called <i>Bela</i> or <i>Bael</i> in India. The fruit of the Malakabuyaw is ovoid and full of a mucilaginous pulp, aromatic and acid, the same as that of the
Bael. The uses of the latter are the following: The pulp acts as an astringent, but it would be more correctly called a tonic
of the intestinal mucosa, for it has been experimentally proved that, although it checks diarrh&#339;a, it also acts as a laxative
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>chronic constipation. In both conditions it seems to operate by toning and regulating the functions of the intestine.

</p>
<p>Martin, an English physician, was the first to call attention to the properties of Bael, and according to Dr. Green one dose
of the pulp of the ripe fruit, prepared with sugar and given every morning, is an efficient remedy in the treatment of the
dyspepsia of Europeans in India, especially in the form characterized by constipation and flatulence. The green fruit is a
powerful astringent used by the Hindoos for diarrh&#339;a. In cholera epidemics Dr. Bose advises the daily use of an ice made from
the pulp of the ripe fruit, the object being the regulation of the functions of the intestine.

the additional property of increasing the appetite. If the patient&#8217;s stomach is very weak, the preparation may produce vomiting
in which event it is necessary to give it in small doses or to employ the extract.

<p>According to Dr. G. Bidie, the fruit of the <i>Feronia elephantum</i>, Correa (the species that grows in the Philippines), possesses the same properties as Bael. Its leaves are astringent, aromatic
and carminative, and the gum with which the trunk of the tree is covered is a good substitute for gum arabic.

<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The pulp of the ripe fruit has an agreeable odor and is edible. In India the green fruit is used as an astringent in diarrh&#339;a
and dysentery; the ripe fruit is given in diseases of the gums and as a gargle. Mir Muhammad Husain states that the ripe fruit
is a refrigerant, astringent, cardiac and general tonic, and is very efficacious in the treatment of salivation and ulcers
of the throat, strengthening the gums and operating as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>an astringent. A sorbet made of the ripe fruit whets the appetite and the pulp is used locally for bites of venomous animals.
In the latter case the pulverized bark may be used if the fruit cannot be obtained.

</p>
<p>The fruit of Ferona is a substitute for Bael (<i>&AElig;gle Marmelos</i>), and is used as such by the English physicians in the hospitals of India. The tender leaves have an agreeable aroma similar
to that of anise and are used internally in decoction as a stomachic and carminative.

</p>
<p>The incised trunk exudes a gum which is used in India as a substitute for gum arabic and there is an active trade in this
gum in the bazars of Bombay and Calcutta. According to Pereira, it was at one time imported into England from the east of
India under the name of gum arabic. It exists in the form of irregular, semitransparent pieces, of a brownish-red color. With
water it forms a mucilage as adhesive as gum arabic, and this solution reddens litmus paper. It is dextrogyrous and is precipitated
by the neutral acetate of lead and by caustic baryta.

stand in them 6&#8211;12 hours, thus preparing a solution of the bitter principle of the plant which they use in various stomach
disorders.

</p>
<p>Vrij has extracted from the seeds a 33% oil of a bright yellow color, composed, according to Oudermans, of 84 parts olein
to 16 of palmitin and stearin.

</p>
<p>The bitter principle contained in the root, wood and bark was discovered by Blunse who named it <i>samaderin</i>; it is a white, crystalline, foliaceous substance, more soluble in water than in alcohol, fusible. Nitric and hydrochloric
acids color it yellow. Sulphuric acid immediately forms a violet red color which disappears as iridescent, feathery crystals
are precipitated. (D. Beaumentz et Egasse.)

</p>
<p>The Filipino &#8220;herb-doctors&#8221; concoct an oil of manungal that in reality contains none of the ingredients of the seeds; it is
simply cocoanut oil in which chips of the wood have been soaked. They use it in doses of 30&#8211;60 grams as a purgative, externally
as an application to the abdomen in colic or indigestion and with friction in rheumatism or contusions. In India the oil extracted
from the seeds is used locally with friction in rheumatism.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The ripe pili nut is edible and sold in confectioneries. It yields a fixed oil, an excellent sample of which was sent by
the Manila pharmacist D. A. del Rosario to the Paris Exposition of 1889. &#8220;It is an oil very similar to oil of almond and owing
to its physical properties may be used as a substitute for the latter for all the requirements of pharmacy. The only inconvenience
connected with its use is the slight one that it solidifies at 3&deg; C. It could furthermore be very advantageously used in the
manufacture of fine grades of soap.&#8221; (D. A. del Rosario.)

</p>
<p>The incised trunk exudes a gum-resin called <i>brea blanca</i> (white pitch) in the Philippines and <i>elemi</i> in Europe. Until recently it was not known in Europe what tree yielded the gum elemi, some authors stating that according
to Blanco it was the resin of the <i>Icica abilo</i>, Blanco (<i>Garuga floribunda</i>, Decsne); it is not true, however, that Padre Blanco ever attributed such origin to that product or named his Icica the &#8220;pitch-tree.&#8221;
On the contrary in speaking of the Canarium, Blanco states that it yields a resin called &#8220;pili-pitch.&#8221; I do not know the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>reason for this confusion of terms, but presume it to be due to imperfect knowledge of Spanish on the part of those who thus
quote Blanco.

</p>
<p>Pili-pitch, or elemi, as they call it in Manila, is a substance existing in soft masses, slightly yellowish or gray, resembling
old honey in appearance. Its odor is strong and agreeable, somewhat like that of lemon and turpentine. Its taste is acrid
and bitter.

</p>
<p>The French pharmacist Meaujean demonstrated in 1820 that elemi contains two resins, one soluble in the cold, and the other
in hot spirits of wine. Other chemists, among them Baup, Fl&uuml;ckiger and Hanbury, have found elemi to be composed of a resinous
substance and a colorless essential oil; the proportion of the latter Fl&uuml;ckiger gives as 10% and further states that it is
dextrogyrous. Sainte-Claire Deville found the essential oil levogyrous, a fact that emphasizes the probability of there being
different products in the market bearing the name of elemi.

</p>
<p>Baup obtained several principles from it: (1) A resin, <i>brein</i>, fusible at 187&deg;, soluble in cold alcohol, crystallizable in oblique rhombic prisms; (2) another crystalline substance, <i>bryoidin</i>, soluble in 360 parts water at 10&deg;, and melting at 13&deg;; (3) a small amount of <i>breidin</i>, a body soluble in 260 parts water and melting at 100&deg;+; (4) another resin soluble in boiling alcohol, called <i>amyrin</i>.

</p>
<p>White pitch is used in the Philippines to make plasters which they apply to the back and breast of patients suffering from
bronchial or pulmonary complaints; it is also applied to indolent ulcers. We believe that elemi possesses the same properties
as copaiba, and that its indications for internal use are the same.

<p>This drug is also tonic, febrifuge and astringent, and a decoction of its leaves and flowers is used as a wash for ulcers.
Some believe that the leaves and fruit contain toxic principles, which may well be true considering the effects of large doses
of their preparations. It has also been observed that the bark collected in March and April may cause dilatation of the pupil,
stupor, etc.; this may be explained by the fact that at this season the sap is rising in the tree and the bark contains an
increased amount of active ingredients.

once proclaimed by Dr. Herklots as the sovereign remedy for beriberi.

</p>
<p>This oil in doses of 10&#8211;15 drops a day is a very powerful stimulant, the action of which is manifested by profuse perspiration
several hours after its administration. Malcolmson reports that it has given him good results in several cases of beriberi,
particularly in recent cases and those in which nervous and paralytic symptoms predominated. In Concan, the juice of the leaves
is given in doses of 30 grams as an antidote for opium. The bruised seeds made into a paste with cow urine are used locally
in treatment of itch. They are also used in the treatment of leprosy, gout, rheumatism, and other diseases which according
to their medical theories, are derived from &#8220;cold humors.&#8221; For these purposes they give the seeds internally, beginning with
one and increasing daily until 50 are taken. At the same time they make external applications of the oil or of another compound
prepared in the following way:

</p>
<p>Place in an open pot with one opening, seeds of <i>C. paniculata</i>, cloves, benzoin, nutmeg and mace. The pot having been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>previously heated, is covered with another, inverted over the opening.

<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The dried and pulverized kernel of the seed is used as an anthelmintic in doses of 1&frac12;&#8211;2 grams both in India and Brazil. The
same preparation is used in the Philippines in the treatment of dysentery and diarrh&#339;a and its effect is doubtless due to
the large quantity of tannin it contains. It is administered as follows: The pounded kernels of 20&#8211;25 seeds are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>brought to a boil in 2 bottles (sic) of water. When the liquid has evaporated a third, it is removed from the fire, cooled,
decanted, and again placed on the fire after adding three to four hundred grams of sugar. This time it is allowed to boil
till reduced to one bottle. The dose is 50&#8211;60 grams 2&#8211;3 times a day. Incisions in the trunk exude a brownish resin which solidifies
in the air, is slightly acrid, bitter, dissolves in alcohol and partially in water. In Malabar it is given internally in the
treatment of diarrh&#339;a and dysentery, mixing it with white of egg and opium. But the curative value of the combination is more
likely due to the albumen and opium than to the resin. Dissolved in lemon juice it is a useful application in the itch. The
trunk bark is astringent and is employed in decoction as a wash for ulcers and eczema and as an injection in leucorrh&#339;a.

</p>
<p>The fruit is one of the most highly prized in the Philippines, and resident Europeans are able to eat large quantities of

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The pericarp of the nut contains an essential oil which is very irritant and used by the Hindoos as a vesicant; it severely
blisters the lips and tongues of imprudent persons who break the nut without taking the precaution of cleansing it of the
oil before opening it. In addition to the oil called <i>cardol</i>, the pericarp contains an especial acid <i>anacardic</i>, a little tannin and ammonia. Cardol (C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>31</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is an oleaginous, yellow liquid very unstable, neutral, soluble in alcohol and ether, insoluble in water, volatile, and
vesicant if applied to the skin. &#8220;Anacardic&#8221; acid is white, crystalline, odorless, with a burning, aromatic taste. It melts
at 26&deg; and decomposes at 200&deg; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>forming a colorless oil; it is not vesicant, burns with a dark flame, and has the odor of rancid oil. A tincture of the pericarp
has been made (1 part to 10 of alcohol) and given internally as a vermifuge in doses of 2&#8211;10 drops. Cardol, according to some
authors, does not exercise a vesicant action in the gastro-intestinal canal, because it is not dissolved by the gastro-intestinal
juices; I am sure, however, that I have seen a choleraic diarrh&#339;a brought on by swallowing, in fun, the pericarp of one nut
and a half. Cardol is eliminated by the urine.

</p>
<p>The kernel is edible and has a very agreeable taste when roasted. By expression it yields a sweet, yellowish oil, density
0.916.

</p>
<p>The trunk exudes a gum resin in masses varying in color from red to yellow.

</p>
<p>The fleshy part, called the fruit, is edible but contains a certain quantity of cardol not only evidenced by the odor but
by the smarting of the mouth and throat after eating. It is very juicy and the expressed liquid is fermented in Bombay and
distilled to make a very weak alcohol which sells for the very low price of 4 annas (5 cents gold) a gallon. This alcohol
is again distilled and a stronger obtained which sells for 1&frac12; rupees a gallon. The Portuguese of India make a sort of wine
from the fermented juice of the fruit, which, like the weak alcohol we have mentioned, is a well-known diuretic and is used
as a liniment.

</p>
<p>The gum resin of the trunk contains 90% of anacardic acid and 10% cardol. Wood soaked in it is preserved from the ravages
of insects, especially of white ants, for which purpose it is used by bookbinders also. Therapeutically it is used externally
in leprosy, old ulcers and to destroy corns, but on account of its rubefacient and vesicant qualities it is necessary to use
it cautiously.

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The part of the plant most important in therapeutics is the seed, the size of a small pea, bright red with a black spot,
hard and shining. The Filipino children use them to make rosaries and other decorations. In the distant past the Filipinos
used these seeds to weigh gold, a practice followed even to-day by the Hindoos. The famous Susrutas, author of the &#8220;Ayur Veda,&#8221;
recommends them internally for nervous diseases; modern therapeutics, however, limits their use to one disease, though that
is frequent and stubborn enough, namely chronic granular conjunctivitis.

</p>
<p>Some physicians state that these seeds are poisonous and others the contrary, but the fact that they are used as food among
the poor classes of Egypt, demonstrates their harmlessness in the digestive tract at least; when introduced into the circulation
they undoubtedly exercise a toxic effect. We have already mentioned that their use is limited nowadays to the therapeutics
of the eye; the decoction of the seeds known in Europe under the name of &#8220;Jaqueriti&#8221;&#8212;so named in Brazil&#8212;produces a purulent
inflammation of the healthy conjunctiva and it is precisely this counter-irritant effect which makes it useful in chronic
granular conjunctivitis, the persistence of which has defied the most heroic measures of therapeutics. The French oculist,
Dr. de Wecker, was the first to employ jequirity for this purpose, in the form of a 24 hours&#8217; maceration of the seeds, 10
grams to 500 grams of water. It is necessary to use a product recently prepared and with this several applications a day are
made. It is now known that the inflammation of the healthy conjunctiva is not caused by germ-life contained in the solution
but by an inorganic ferment discovered by Bruylans and Venneman and named jequiritin; they state that it is produced during
the germination of the seeds or of the cells in the powdered seeds. Warden and Waddell, of Calcutta, have isolated an essential
oil, an acid named &#8220;&aacute;bric&#8221; and an amorphous substance called abrin, obtained by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>precipitation with alcohol from a watery infusion of the pulverized seeds. Its action is identical with that of &#8220;jequiritin.&#8221;

</p>
<p>The infusion appears to possess considerable value as a stimulating application to indolent ulcers.

</p>
<p>The root is a good substitute for licorice, is emollient and has an agreeable taste. The extract is useful in catarrhal diseases
of the bronchi and in dysuria. The leaves contain the same properties as the root and an extract prepared from them is used
as a substitute for licorice.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;This tree is well known on account of the beauty of its crimson flowers. The decoction of the leaves is a useful cleansing
and deodorizing application for ulcers. The bruised leaves are used locally in painful affections of the joints and to abort
syphilitic buboes and abscesses of all kinds. The juice of the tender leaves is used in Concan to destroy maggots in ulcers,
and the powder has a similar use. A decoction is used locally in ophthalmia.

</p>
<p>The root and the leaves are used as a febrifuge in the Philippines and in India, according to Wight. In Brazil the bark is
given in small repeated doses as a hypnotic and in the Philippines as a diuretic and purgative; a decoction of the leaves
is similarly used. The bark contains an alkaloid discovered by Rochefontaine and Rey, called <i>erythrin</i>, which acts upon the central nervous system, diminishing its normal functions even to the point of abolishment, without modifying
motor excitability or muscular contractility. W. Young isolated a glucoside, <i>migarrhin</i>, similar to saponin, but possessing the additional property of dilating the pupil.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The pounded seeds mixed with oil are used locally for painful joints. They possess purgative and emetic properties and Dr.
J. Shartt has employed a mixture of the powdered roasted seeds, 8 grams, with double the quantity of acid tartrate of potassium.
Its action is gentle, but sure. The alcoholic extract of the root, a soft, brown, resinous substance with an odor recalling
that of jalap, is a very active cathartic, producing sharp effects in doses of 30&#8211;60 centigrams; in fact it produces such
severe tenesmus that its use in such doses should not be recommended.

</p>
<p>The root bark is used internally in an infusion (4&#8211;8 grams to 1 liter of water) as an emollient in irritability of the bladder
and urethra and has been recommended for such a purpose by Mooden Sheriff. It is a diuretic which frequently acts as a purgative,
a fact that is not surprising in view of the above-mentioned properties of the alcoholic extract.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93">93</a>]</span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The wood of the first is the so-called &#8220;red sandalwood.&#8221; It is used for building purposes and, in medicine, as an astringent.
In decoction it is used as a gargle for sore throat. The second is also an excellent building material and is used medicinally
for its astringent properties. A decoction of sufficient strength to color the water a light blue is used as a mouth wash
in toothache and has some reputation as a solvent of vesical calculi. All three species yield a resin known in pharmacy under
the name of &#8220;kino.&#8221; The true gum kino is really <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94">94</a>]</span>produced by the <i>P. marsupium</i>, Roxb., but the Philippine product, especially that of the second and third species, has for a long time been exported to
Europe under the name of &#8220;red astringent gum&#8221; or &#8220;kino.&#8221; This name is given to the sap of these trees dried without the aid
of artificial heat. The bark is the part which produces it and the following extractive process is employed in Madras: a vertical
incision is made in the trunk and lateral incisions perpendicular to it and a receptacle is placed at the foot of the tree.
This soon fills and when the gum is sufficiently dried by air and sun it is packed in boxes and exported.

</p>
<p>In respect to appearance, solubility and chemical composition, Fl&uuml;ckiger and Hanbury were unable to discover any difference
between the kino of <i>P. marsupium</i>, Roxb., and that of <i>P. erinaceus</i>, Poir. It is therefore interesting to consider a product that is identical with that described in the pharmacop&#339;ias as produced
by the <i>P. marsupium</i>, Roxb., though the latter does not grow in the Philippines.

</p>
<p>Kino is at present used but little in therapeutics and its action is analogous to that of tannin and catechu. It is given
internally for its astringent effect in chronic diarrh&#339;a, leucorrh&#339;a, blenorrh&#339;a and hemorrhages. The dose of the powder is
1&#8211;4 grams, and of the alcoholic tincture, containing 20 parts kino to 100 of alcohol, 5&#8211;10 grams. In prolapse of the rectum
and anal fissure the following solution is used by enema:

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Dose.</span>&#8212;1&#8211;2 grams 3 times a day.

</p>
<p>In the Philippines the powdered seed is given in affections of the digestive tract, especially in diarrh&#339;a and feeble digestion.
The same name of Bonduc is given to the seeds of another species that grows in the Philippines, <i>C. Bonduc</i>, Roxb.; <i>Kamot-Kabag</i>, <i>Bayan-Kambig&#771;</i>, Tag. The seeds are identical in chemical composition and therapeutic indication.

</p>
<p>The two principal substances contained in the seeds are an oil, 24% and a resin, 1.88%. The former is straw-colored and slightly
bitter by virtue of the presence of a resin that may be precipitated by alcohol. The resin or bitter principle exists as an
amorphous powder, white, bitter, not acrid, soluble in chloroform, alcohol, acetone, crystallizable acetic acid, fixed and
essential oils; slightly soluble in ether and bisulphide of carbon, insoluble in water and petroleum ether. The alkalies do
not affect it. It melts at 140&deg;, decomposing and leaving only a carbon. Its discoverers, Heckel and <span class="corr" id="xd0e5569" title="Source: Schlagdenhaussen">Schlagdenhauffen</span>, have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97">97</a>]</span>given it the name <i>bonducin</i> (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>15</sub>O<sub>5</sub>). Hydrochloric acid colors it red; sulphuric acid, a maranthin red in half an hour.

</p>
<p>Bonducin seems to be the active principle of the seeds and is given internally in doses of 10&#8211;20 centigrams; according to
Dr. Isnard, of Marseilles, this dose has given as good results in fevers as the same quantity of quinine.

<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The decoction of Sibukao is given in hemorrhages, especially of the lungs. It is probably the red color of this decoction
which originated the idea of giving it to check bleeding, and this is the practice of the native Filipino doctors, as well
as of the Arabs and Hindoos. The natives of Cochin China, reasoning in an opposite manner, prescribe it as emmenagogue. Some
authors recommend Sibukao as a substitute for logwood. The decoction is administered in chronic diarrh&#339;a, especially <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>that of children. A few cases of phlebitis have been reported as occasioned by its use. The extract is made as follows:

<p>Sibukao contains much tannin and gallic acid, and a peculiar substance which distinguishes it from logwood, <i>brasilin</i> (C<sub>22</sub>H<sub>20</sub>O<sub>7</sub>), which gives a red color to alkaline solutions instead of blue or purple. It is a crystalline pigment which may be considered
a compound of hematoxylon and fenol.

of commerce, and there is no fear of logwood being substituted for it, as the latter is more expensive, and substitutions
are not ordinarily made under such circumstances. In commerce it occurs in large pieces of all shapes and forms, since the
branches and trunks are cut into pieces which vary from 1/2&#8211;2 meters in length. Its color is reddish-yellow or white with

<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;In Brazil they use an infusion of the root as a tonic and diuretic, 4 grams of the root bark and 180 of boiling water to

Thirty grams of fresh leaves are boiled <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101">101</a>]</span>in 300 grams of water till the liquid is reduced to 250 grams. The patient takes this decoction hot the first day of the fever
and a profuse perspiration promptly breaks out. As a rule the effect is immediate and the fever does not recur. This treatment
of fevers is more common in that country than that by quinine and they claim that it has the advantage over the latter of
acting as a stomachic tonic. By adding a small quantity of the roots to the decoction it is rendered diuretic. The seeds possess
the same properties and are used in decoctions of 30 grams to 300 of water. According to De Lanesan the roasted seeds are
used in La R&eacute;union in infusion similar to coffee in the treatment of gastralgia and asthma. In some countries they mix them
with coffee just as chicory is used in Europe.

<p>Previous to the studies of the above authors the seeds had been therapeutically tested by Delioux de Savignac and Professor
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102">102</a>]</span>Clouet. Heckel and Schlagdenhauffen have confirmed the febrifuge virtues of the seeds and are uncertain as to the active principle
since they found no glucoside or alkaloid in their analysis. The antiperiodic properties are comparable with those of quinine
and have even proved effective in some cases in which quinine failed. It seems quite clear that the tannin is the active principle
which is the more probable because its anti-periodic virtues are now recognized by all therapeutists.

</p>
<p>It is given in maceration or infusion, 2&#8211;15 grams of the seeds to 3 or 400 of water to be taken several times a day. The treatment
causes no very marked physiological effects. It seems to act as a sedative to the nervous system.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;This is one of the most popular Philippine remedies and its usefulness is vouched for by many physicians practicing in many
different lands. Its antiherpetic properties are notable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103">103</a>]</span>and the Tagalo name of the plant, &#8220;Gamut sa Buni,&#8221; means literally &#8220;medicine for herpes.&#8221; The natives use the juice of the
leaf applied locally to the affected part. These properties have long been familiar to the Malays and to the Hindoos who in
their medical works give the plant the Sanscrit name of &#8220;Dadrughna,&#8221; meaning &#8220;to cure herpes.&#8221; The Pharmacop&#339;ia of Bengal
recommends cassia in the form of an ointment made by mixing the crushed tender leaves with simple ointment. This preparation
is, in our opinion, undesirable on account of its liability to become rancid and vaseline should be the excipient used. Another
application for herpetic eruptions is the juice of the leaves mixed with an equal quantity of lemon juice. The Malays use
the leaves dried in the sun, adding to them a little water and rubbing them briskly on the affected parts, the vigorous treatment
being an important part of the cure.

</p>
<p>The decoction of the leaves is a laxative and according to Mr. J. Wood the tincture has an action similar to that of senna.
Dr. Pulney Andy of India states that the extract prepared from the tender leaves is a good substitute for extract of colocynth.

</p>
<p>Mr. A. Porte claims to have obtained the best results with an acetic extract of the fresh leaves. The following is his formula:

<p>Macerate 10 or 12 days, filter and express, then filter again and evaporate to the consistency of an extract.

</p>
<p>The seeds contain vermifuge principles.

</p>
<p>The activity of this plant in herpes is due to the chrysophanic acid contained in it. The more recent the eruption the more
certain is the effect.

between stones it is sold under the name of &#8220;gogo&#8221;; it is macerated in water, to which it imparts a reddish color, and forms
a substitute for soap. The Filipinos use this preparation for bathing, especially the hair, for which purpose there is no
more useful or simple preparation. It cures pityriasis, and renders the hair very soft, without drying it too much as is usually
the case with soap. The natives use it in treating the itch, washing the affected parts with the maceration and at the same
time briskly rubbing them with the bark; in this way <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107">107</a>]</span>they remove the crusts that shield the acari. The treatment is successful in direct proportion to the energy of rubbing.

</p>
<p>The seeds of &#8220;gogo&#8221; are very large, lenticular, flattened, 3&#8211;4 centimeters in diameter. Their chemical composition has been
studied by Pettit. Alcohol dissolves the active principle, perhaps a glucoside, the study of which the author has not completed.
Five centigrams of this substance administered to a guinea-pig causes paralysis of the hind quarters without any apparent
inflammation. He also found saponin in the seeds, but it exists in much greater quantity in the trunk. In the Sunda Islands
they eat the seeds roasted and also extract from them an illuminating oil.

<p>The tree exudes an abundant gum very similar to gum arabic which latter is the product of another species of acacia (<i>A. Arabica</i>, Willd.). The Manila pharmacist, D. Anacleto del Rosario, sent to the Paris Exposition of 1899 a specimen of this gum obtained
on the plantation of D. P. P. Roxas, in Batangas. This specimen differed in no respect from gum arabic and it will surely
sooner or later take the place of the latter in the Philippines, both for pharmaceutical and industrial purposes. It would

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The ripe fruit, called <i>myrobalans</i> in India, is purgative and six of them pounded up and given in decoction operate with certainty, producing 4 or 5 copious
evacuations without nausea or other disagreeable symptoms. Dr. Waring has experimented with them and recommends them highly.
The taste may be made more agreeable by adding a little cinnamon to the decoction. Dymock states that three fruits are sufficient,
and Dr. Hove gives one as the effective dose. This lack of agreement may be explained by the fact that the fruits are of different
sizes, and probably Waring refers to those of medium size. Contrary to what one would imagine, judging from its purgative
action, the fruit contains astringent principles, and makes an effective injection for leucorrh&#339;a as a substitute for nut
galls. It is also of some merit in the treatment of piles.

</p>
<p>The green fruit is highly esteemed by Radja Kalikesen as a carminative, tonic and purgative. Dr. Twining also mentions these
same properties, recommends it as a tonic and aperient of great benefit in atony of the digestive organs and expresses surprise
that the Europeans make no use of it. According to the same author a dose in the treatment of diarrh&#339;a and dysentery is 4
grams twice a day. He quotes a case of hypertrophy of the spleen which he cured with this fruit.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112">112</a>]</span></p>
<p>Some of the leaves bear horn-shaped galls, flattened, narrow and hollow. They are caused by an insect which stings the leaves
and deposits its eggs in them. These leaves with galls are astringent and very useful and effective in dysentery and diarrh&#339;a,
especially that of children. The dose for a child of more than one year is 0.40 to 0.50 gram a day, administered in fractional
doses every two or three hours.

</p>
<p>Fridolin has obtained from its fruit an acid, which he calls <i>chebulinic</i> (C<sub>28</sub>H<sub>25</sub>O<sub>10</sub>) and presumes to be a mixture of tannic and gallic acids. As Stenhouse had formerly indicated, no principle has been discovered
to which the purgative properties can be attributed, unless it be a green oleo-resin turned red by nitric acid, obtained from
the fruit by Apery.

<p>Dujardin-Beaumetz has tested the therapeutic value of these seeds in diabetes but with negative results. Scott has maintained
that by adding the powdered seed to a mixture of malt and starch, fermentation is impeded; but Dr. Villy in the laboratory
of Dujardin-Beaumetz has demonstrated that such is not the case. Contrary to the opinions of those physicians who stated that
&#8220;jambul&#8221; was capable of causing the glucose to disappear from the urine of diabetic patients without concurrent diabetic regimen,
Dujardin-Beaumetz observed in his trials of the drug that the slightest relaxation of the regimen was followed by an increase
of glucose. Under the influence of the medicine in doses of 2&#8211;10 grams daily, at the same time maintaining a strict diabetic
diet, the Parisian therapeutist noted that the glucose disappears from the third to the fifth day; but this occurred only
in cases of medium intensity, whereas in severe cases the medication produced no effect. Upon stopping the treatment the sugar

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses</span>.&#8212;The leaves contain an irritant and acrid principle that renders them vesicant when applied to the skin. The Pharmacop&#339;ia
of India quotes Sir W. O&#8217;Shaughnessy to the effect that plasters made of the bruised leaves even when renewed every half hour
require 24 hours to raise a blister and at the same time cause severe pain. He found it much more painful than cantharides
and much less prompt to act. Dr. Dymock has prepared an ethereal tincture of the leaves and obtained with it results very
different from those just mentioned; this is not surprising in view of the fact that the tincture holds in solution in a small
quantity of ether, a considerable amount of the vesicant principle. This tincture has the same color as the &#8220;epispastic&#8221; of
the English Pharmacop&#339;ia, causes less pain and rapidly raises a good blister, facts of which I have convinced myself by the
use of a small quantity sent me from Bombay in 1891.

<p>If the ethereal tincture be evaporated a resinous residue remains that has not been studied, but appears to be the vesicant
principle. This tincture should be made from the dried leaves to avoid hydration of the ether.

finger tips and palms of the hands. There is a tradition among the Mohammedans that the Prophet once called this plant &#8220;the
best of all herbs.&#8221; The leaf in form of a dry powder is sold in the bazars of India under the name of &#8220;henna&#8221;; mixed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119">119</a>]</span>with water it gives it a yellow color, and when boiled the tone of the liquid becomes darker; the addition of an alkali turns
it brown. In Persia they add indigo to this solution and use it as a hair dye.

</p>
<p>The Hindoos apply the bruised leaves to the soles of the feet of small-pox patients, their purpose being to prevent the spread
of the eruption to the eyes. They also use it locally in a disease known among them as &#8220;burning of the feet.&#8221; Grierson and
Waring obtained good results in this disease by making a paste of the bruised leaves and vinegar; cases that resisted such
treatment yielded completely to a brisk rubbing of the feet with a simple paste of the leaf. The decoction and the bruised
leaves are also used locally for contusions.

</p>
<p>The bark has been given in jaundice, hypertrophy of the spleen, calculi of various sorts, leprosy and stubborn skin diseases,
as an alterative. In decoction it is applied to burns.

</p>
<p>An English physician, Dr. Newton, made an extract of the leaves and flowers with which he pretended to cure leprosy; it was
but one more useless drug in the long list used to combat that terrible disease. The dose of the extract is a teaspoonful
daily, given in 2 doses.

</p>
<p>The juice of the leaves is given in sweetened water in some countries as a remedy for spermatorrh&#339;a.

</p>
<p>The flowers are given in decoction for headache and the fruit is emmenagogue.

</p>
<p>The peel of the fruit is highly astringent and in decoction is a useful agent in treating chronic diarrh&#339;a, and locally in
injections of lotions for leucorrh&#339;a and inflamed h&aelig;morrhoids. It should not be given when rectal tenesmus exists. The Pharmacop&#339;ia
of India contains the following formula for preparing the decoction of the peel:

</p>
<p>Boil for 15 minutes in a covered vessel, cool, filter and add water enough to make a liter. Dose, 30&#8211;50 grams per diem.

</p>
<p>This preparation is also used in astringent gargles and injections. For internal use the decoction is rendered more active
by adding a small quantity of cloves or cinnamon. This mixture with the addition of opium gives excellent results in the treatment
of diarrh&#339;a among the natives of India and is highly recommended by Dr. Kirkpatrick.

</p>
<p>The most important part of the pomegranate, however, is its root, the bark of which is a very efficient t&aelig;nifuge and the most
astringent portion of the plant. It should be used fresh, as drying destroys its activity and gives negative results. Many
failures to expel the t&aelig;nia are probably due to this fact. According to B&eacute;ranger-F&eacute;raud the root gives 25% to 40% of cures,
whereas pumpkin seeds give but 5% to 10%.

<p>Macerate 6 hours, boil over slow fire till reduced to 500 grams. Strain. Administer fasting, in 3 doses half an hour apart.
The evening before the patient should eat a light meal and take a cathartic in order that the intestinal canal may contain
the smallest possible quantity of f&aelig;cal matter. After taking the third dose of the decoction the patient should take a mild
purgative such as 30 grams of castor oil to expel the t&aelig;nia. This preparation has a most disagreeable taste. It is better
to give the &#8220;tannate of pelletierine,&#8221; a compound of tannin and one of the alkaloids that Tanret discovered in pomegranate
root. A sufficient dose of tannate of pelletierine is 30&#8211;40 centigrams in wafer form, followed by a purge and with the other
precautions and preparatory measures mentioned above. It causes toxic symptoms similar to those produced by curare, according
to the experimental studies of Dujardin-Beaumetz and Rocheni&egrave;re. Its action is upon the ends of the motor nerves. A dose of
40 centigrams may cause in man such symptoms of intoxication as vertigo, inverted vision and muscular paralysis. Pelletierine
should not be administered to children, but B&eacute;ranger-F&eacute;raud states that the tannate may be safely given them, as follows:

</div><p>

</p>
<p>A coffee-spoonful of this solution contains 0.03 gram of the tannate, and this quantity may be given to a child, in a little
milk. If no symptoms supervene within one-half hour give another similar dose and so on up to 3 or 4 doses or .12 gm. in all.
After the last dose give the purgative as a routine. It is certainly imprudent to trust the administration of such a drug
to any one incapable of recognizing the symptoms of intoxication, and as no one but a physician can judge the effects of the
alkaloid he himself should remain with the patient until the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122">122</a>]</span>efficient dose has been absorbed. This is manifestly impractical and we therefore maintain that the alkaloid is not suited
for the treatment of children.

<p>An analysis of the root bark made by the French chemist Tanret revealed the presence of four alkaloids: pelletierine, isopelletierine

<p><span class="smallcaps">Nom. Vulg</span>.&#8212;<i>Papaya</i>, in many Phil. dialects; <i>Papaya</i>, <i>Papaw</i>, Eng.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses</span>.&#8212;The decoction of the leaves is used locally in sores and atonic ulcers, followed by a poultice of the boiled and mashed
leaves. The natives use the cold infusion of the leaves to wash clothes spotted with blood and the spots disappear rapidly
by virtue of the ferment papain which digests the fibrin. The infusion is also very useful as a wash for sores and gangrenous
ulcers, modifying their appearance very rapidly.

</p>
<p>Before proceeding further it is desirable to give a description of papain, a digestive ferment which exists throughout the
whole plant, fruit, trunk, leaves and petioles; it is contained in the milky juice which exudes from all these parts when
cut. This juice was studied simultaneously by Wurtz in France and Peckolt in Brazil. The best method of collecting it is to
make several superficial, longitudinal incisions in the green fruit without removing it from the tree; immediately an abundance
of juice appears in the incisions and coagulates rapidly. The best time to do this is the early morning. The fruit does not
suffer by this process but continues developing and ripens perhaps more rapidly, at the same time improving in flavor, becoming
sweeter; the seeds, however, atrophy and lose their power of germination. Peckolt gives the following as the composition of
the juice:

<p>The milky juice is neutral and coagulates rapidly, separating in two parts: a kind of insoluble pulp and a limpid colorless
serum. If combined with fibrin, raw meat, white of egg or gluten it gradually softens them and completely dissolves them in
3 or 4 hours <i>in vitro</i> at 40&deg; C. Combined with milk it coagulates it and soon precipitates the casein which is also dissolved a little later. It
digests lumbricoids and tape-worms and the false membrane of croup, in a few hours. According to Wurtz and Bouchut papain
is prepared as follows:

</p>
<p>The fluid juice or the aqueous solution of the milky exudate is precipitated by the addition of ten times the volume of alcohol.
The precipitate, after treating again with concentrated alcohol, is dissolved in water and the addition of sub-acetate of
lead eliminates the albuminoids and peptones but does not precipitate the papain. The liquid is filtered and the lead salts
separated by means of a current of hydrogen sulphide. It is filtered again and alcohol added gradually, which process first
precipitates whatever sulphate of lead may have passed through the filter, and then the papain.

</p>
<p>Papain is an amorphous substance, perfectly white, soluble in water, insipid, odorless. An aqueous solution, if shaken violently,
foams like a solution of soap. Boiling makes it turbid and when concentrated it has a slightly astringent taste. It is precipitated
by hydrochloric, nitric, picric and the metaphosphoric acids. Trommer&#8217;s test gives it a beautiful blue violet color which,
on boiling, changes to a red violet.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125">125</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is an extremely active digestive ferment, comparable with pepsin, but superior to the latter because it does not require
an acid medium, as its digestive action takes place even in the presence of an alkaline medium and of antiseptic substances
such as boric acid, phenol, etc. It is given in doses of 10&#8211;40 centigrams in different vehicles such as water, wine, etc.
It should be given after meals carefully and properly diluted, in order that its action may not be exerted upon the gastric
mucous membrane itself. Its use is contraindicated in gastric ulcer.

</p>
<p>A watery solution prepared by macerating the green fruit has been used effectively to remove blemishes from the face, leaving
the skin clean and smooth. The natives use little pieces of the green fruit to remove freckles (which they call <i>pecas</i>). The ripe fruit is edible and its taste quite agreeable; in some of the Malay Islands it is given for dysentery, but it
must be remembered that the ripe fruit does not contain papain.

</p>
<p>The pure exudate is given to children as an anthelmintic in doses of 2&#8211;6 grams with a little molasses, but it is not so harmless
that it may be used with impunity in this form, Moncorvo and others having reported cases of peritonitis with symptoms suggestive
of cholera following its use. It is drastic and digestive in addition to its anthelmintic action, but according to Rabuteau,
boiling destroys the first property without affecting the others. Dr. Lemarchand of the island of Mauritius gives the following
anthelmintic prescription:

<p>Cool and administer in one dose followed immediately by 30 grams of castor oil. For a child, one-half dose.

</p>
<p>This treatment frequently causes colic, for the relief of which the author advises an injection of sweetened water. Sir O&#8217;Shaughnessy&#8217;s
prescription is preferable:

</p>
<p>This dose cannot cause any untoward symptoms and is efficient in expelling both lumbricoids and t&aelig;ni&aelig;.

</p>
<p>The triturated seeds may be given internally in doses of 1&#8211;2 grams with milk or molasses to expel lumbricoids. Analysis has
revealed in the seeds the presence of a resinous oil, an oleaginous material of disagreeable odor and taste called by Peckolt
<i>caricin</i>, a fatty acid, papayic acid and a resin. In India the seeds are considered emmenagogue. In some countries they wrap meat
in papaya leaves for several hours before eating in order to soften it. For the same purpose they sometimes boil the meat
in water containing a few leaves or pieces of the green fruit; some even go to the length of saying that it is only necessary
to hang a piece of meat in a papaya tree for a time in order to soften it.

</p>
<p>The decoction of the green fruit is given internally for indigestion, a treatment common in the provinces of Bulacan and Pampanga.
The milky juice is used to remove corns and Dr. Daruty offers the following prescription for eczema and psoriasis:

that the leaves, as well as the fruit, are bitter and purgative and that the Tamuls use them for their laxative and stomachic
effect. Drury states that on the Malabar coast the seeds have a considerable reputation as a remedy for functional disorders
of the stomach. Although the green fruit is very bitter the natives of that region use it as a condiment. The tender stems
and the dry capsules, both bitter and purgative, are given in infusion and in a sweetened solution, as an aid to digestion.
The seeds are febrifuge and anthelmintic. The juice of the leaves is emetic and that of the roots purgative. The decoction

<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The three above-mentioned varieties of <i>L. vulgaris</i>, Ser., are commonly grouped under the name calabaza (gourd). All have the same action and hence the same therapeutic application.
The green portion of the rind is bitter and possesses purgative and emetic properties. The decoction of the tender shoots
is expectorant; in addition it appears to possess purgative properties and in India is used in jaundice.

</p>
<p>The part of the plant most generally used is the seeds, the t&aelig;nifuge properties of which are well known. Its action, however,
is not always certain, which may be as truly said of all other known t&aelig;nifuges. The seeds have the advantage of lacking the
disgusting taste characteristic of other remedies of the same class; the taste is almost neutral and a little sugar conceals
it completely. The dose is unlimited; some take 15 grams, others as high as 100, and no unpleasant symptoms of any kind have
been reported. The only precaution to be observed is to give the patient a purgative 1&#8211;2 hours after his dose.

</p>
<p>Heckel has analyzed the seeds and found a resin which he calls <i>pepo-resina</i>; it exists in the greenish pellicle that envelopes the embryo and appears to be the active principle of the seeds. Its dose
is 0.80&#8211;1.00 gram (Dujardin-Beaumetz), the product of 250 grams of the seeds. The dose of 100 grams of the seeds mentioned
above is very small, if the pepo-resin represents the entire active principle, for 100 grams of the seeds would only contain
about 40 centigrams.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Botanical Description.</span>&#8212;A very familiar vine, clammy, pubescent and musk-scented; large leaves, long-stalked flowers, white petals, greenish veiny
fruit usually club-shaped or enlarged at the apex, the hard rind used for vessels, dippers, and so forth. It is noteworthy
that none of the t&aelig;nifuge varieties mentioned bears yellow fruit.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Nom. Vulg.</span>&#8212;Probably bears the same names as the <i>Trichosanthes</i>.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The root is a hydragogue cathartic even in minute doses. The fruit is emollient by virtue of the large quantity of mucilage
it contains, but it is more interesting for other properties. When cut in two, deprived of epidermis and seeds, and washed
until none of the mucilage remains, there is left a fibrous skeleton, a sort of skein of interwoven nets that constitutes
the so-called vegetable sponge. It serves the same purpose as a sponge and has the advantages that its fibers do not rot and
that they are easily kept clean. In view of its cheapness and plentifulness in the Philippines the above advantages should
suffice to bring it into universal use for the toilet, for surgical purposes and for cleaning in general.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Botanical Description.</span>&#8212;A vine with square, glabrous stem. Leaves alternate, cordate, 3&#8211;5-lobulate, dentate, rough, 5&#8211;7-nerved. Petioles short. Flowers
mon&#339;cious. Staminate in axillary panicles; calyx bell-shaped; corolla yellow, 5 oval petals, borders entire; stamens 3; filaments
short; two thick ones divide high up in 2 parts, thus giving the appearance of 5 stamens in all. Pistillate axillary, calyx
adherent, 5 pointed sepals; corolla, 5 nearly triangular petals, finely dentate; style thick, short, the base encircled by

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;Dr. Daruty, of Mauritius, has published a study of this plant, giving a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of its composition, therapeutic uses and physiological
action. The writers of antiquity recognized the plant as a powerful alterative, tonic, diuretic, stimulant and vermifuge,
especially effective in secondary syphilis and in ulcerative diseases of the skin.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135">135</a>]</span></p>
<p>L&eacute;pine and Boileau used it experimentally to treat leprosy and reported favorably; but later experience demonstrated that
it did not exercise any specific effect, but benefited an&aelig;sthetic leprosy simply by improving the general condition of the
patient.

</p>
<p>The plant is official in the Pharmacop&#339;ia of India, as alterative, tonic and stimulant. It states that the drug has been found
very useful in the treatment of secondary and constitutional syphilis, when the disease attacks the skin and subcutaneous
tissue.

</p>
<p>In Bombay it is a popular remedy for the mild dysentery of children, given as a decoction of 3 or 4 leaves with a little cumin
seed and sugar; the bruised leaves are then applied to the umbilical region. In the Philippines the decoction of the leaves
is given as a purge.

</p>
<p>Dr. Dervegie reports good results in the treatment of eczema, administering the powdered leaf in dozes of 0.10 gram and applying
locally the powder or an ointment of the same. The most marked and constant effects of the drug are a considerable increase
of the urinary secretion, elevation of the temperature of the skin and profuse diaphoresis.

</p>
<p>Dr. Boileau, quoted above, himself contracted leprosy of which he died; he experimented on himself with &#8220;hydrocotyle&#8221; and
on one occasion a dose of 3 grams nearly proved fatal; tetanic symptoms supervened with suffocation, palpitation, epistaxis
and rectal hemorrhage, abating finally with profuse sweating and diuresis.

</p>
<p>Dr. L&eacute;pine, a pharmacist of Pondicherry, has analyzed the plant and isolated a substance that seems to be the active principle;
he has named it <i>vallarin</i>, from &#8220;vallarai,&#8221; the Tamul name of the plant. &#8220;Vallarin&#8221; is a thick, pale yellow oil of a piquant and persistent taste and
an odor peculiar to the plant. It changes under the influence of air, moisture or heat and volatilizes at 120&deg;. It is soluble
in alcohol. The plant contains 8/10 to 1% of this oil, a dark resin and a green resin.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136">136</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Pharmacop&#339;ia of India gives 2 official formul&aelig;, a powder and a cataplasm. The powdered leaf is given internally in doses
of 0.30 to 1.50 grams and is applied locally to superficial ulcers.

<p><span class="smallcaps">Nom. Vulg</span>.&#8212;<i>Huligaga</i>, Tag.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses</span>.&#8212;The bark of this tree has a wide reputation in India as a tonic and febrifuge. The inner layer of the bark possesses astringent
and bitter properties much like quinine. Ainslie states that it is used in India to tan hides and therapeutically where an
astringent is required. O&#8217;Shaughnessy experimented with it in the hospital of the Medical College of Calcutta and reported
good tonic and antipyretic effects.

</p>
<p>In 1870, according to Dymock, Broughton analyzed the fresh bark and reported that the bitter taste was due to <i>esculin</i>, which after drying and coming in contact with decomposing organic matter is transformed into the almost tasteless <i>esculetin</i>. Naylor studied the bark at a later period, and attributed the bitterness to an alkaloid that he named <i>hymenodictyonine</i>. This substance exists in the form of a gelatinous mass, cream-colored, very hygroscopic. An ethereal solution, carefully
evaporated, deposits it in the form of crystals. Its empirical form is C<sub>23</sub>H<sub>40</sub>N<sub>2</sub>; it is probably volatile and is notable for its lack of oxygen. It differs from <i>quinoidine</i> in that it is inactive (?) and that in combination with platinum it retains less of this metal than does quinoidine. It differs
from <i>paricine</i> in its proportion of hydrogen, and from <i>berberine</i> in containing more carbon. In the presence of sulphuric acid its solution assumes a yellow color, changing to wine-red and
then to dark red. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141">141</a>]</span>Naylor extracted another principle which he found combined with the alkaloid in a soda precipitate of the latter; it is a
product of the decomposition of a glucose, the formula of which is C<sub>25</sub>H<sub>49</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. This compound remains insoluble when the alkaloid is treated with ether. Repeated boiling in alcohol renders it colorless.
It is bitter, soluble in alcohol and dilute acids; insoluble in ether and chloroform. Reaction, neutral.

<p><i>Uses.</i>&#8212;The Sanscrit writers often mention this plant as an important remedy for the fevers due, according to their theories, to
disordered bile, <i>i. e.</i>, remittent fevers, accompanied by gastric irritability and nervous depression. The entire plant is used to make a decoction,
often combined with aromatics. Dymock observed in Goa that this plant could be gotten in all the shops of the herb-venders,
and that it was widely used as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142">142</a>]</span>an alterative in mild fevers in combination with <i>&#8220;Hydrocotyle Asiatica</i> and <i>Adiantum lunulatum</i>.&#8221;

</p>

<p><b>Coffea Arabica</b>, L.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Nom. Vulg.</span>&#8212;<i>Cafe</i>, Sp.; <i>Coffee</i>, Eng.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The infusion of roasted and ground coffee seeds constitutes a beverage of Arabic origin, but now common all over the world.
In the Philippines, where a few years ago the coffee plant was only cultivated in gardens, the harvest has assumed such proportions
that it now constitutes one of the greatest sources of agricultural wealth. Its use is becoming more general every day and
the discovery of its alkaloid &#8220;caffeine&#8221; the therapeutical use of which is also steadily increasing, has given new importance
to the seed on account of its increasing demand in the drug trade. When newly harvested its taste is not very agreeable, for
it needs considerable time&#8212;2 or 3 years&#8212;in which to dry completely, before it acquires the aromatic properties and the savor
of which it is susceptible. General Morin relates an incident of having drunk a delicious infusion of coffee made from authentic
Moka that had been kept for fifty years, of course under ideal conditions of preservation.

</p>
<p>In civilized countries coffee is an article of prime necessity as a food; here we shall consider it therapeutically under
two heads, as a tonic-stimulant and as an antiseptic. As caffeine is the principle that acts upon the heart we shall consider
the cardiac properties of coffee under the head of that alkaloid, so important that it may best be studied separately.

</p>
<p>There are two preparations of coffee, the decoction used by the Arabs and the infusion, used in Europe and adopted in the
Philippines. The decoction forms a tonic and aromatic drink devoid of any excitant properties, but the infusion is highly
excitant and should not be taken in such large amounts as the decoction, for its action may be powerful enough to cause headache,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145">145</a>]</span>nausea, trembling of the extremities and disorders of vision and hearing. These phenomena however are not dangerous and rapidly
subside as soon as the urine eliminates the substances that cause them.

</p>
<p>Infusion of coffee stimulates especially the cerebral functions and the circulation; as to its digestive properties, opinion
is divided but it is more probable that it lacks them and that coffee taken after meals owes its reputation as a digestive
aid to two distinct factors&#8212;the temperature and the sugar. Without doubt it exerts an anaphrodisiac action, on account of
which the illustrious <span class="corr" id="xd0e8120" title="Source: Linneus">Linn&aelig;us</span> called it the &#8220;drink of eunuchs.&#8221; This action seems incompatible with the fact that the Arabs, who are so much given to the
abuse of the pleasures forbidden to eunuchs are most addicted to the use and abuse of coffee. The explanation rests in the
form in which they consume their coffee, namely the decoction, which is free from the sedative principle of the seed, that
undoubtedly resides in the aromatic ingredient &#8220;cafeol.&#8221;

</p>
<p>Coffee is contraindicated in hysterical and nervous persons, in children and in those who suffer with insomnia or palpitation.
It counteracts sleep and coma, being very useful in poisoning by opium or its alkaloids. Its stimulant action is as rapid
as that of alcohol. On several occasions it has yielded me marked results when given by stomach or by enema in cases of nervous
and cardiac depression. Indeed it is a remedy that I cannot recommend too highly and each day leaves me more convinced of
its therapeutic activity and certainty.

</p>
<p>Attention has only lately been directed to the antiseptic property of coffee though we have long been availing ourselves of
that property without knowing it; this is true of many other medicinal agents, indeed of all that the modern studies of bacteriology
have presented to us as antifermentives and microbicides. Roasted coffee in powder form gives good results if dusted over
ulcers and gangrenous sores, rapidly improving their appearance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146">146</a>]</span>and destroying the f&#339;tid odor. It corrects the unhygienic properties of non-potable water and therefore enters into the army
and navy ration of nearly all the nations of Europe. In epidemics of disease every physician should advise its use in mild
infusion as a regular beverage.

</p>
<p>Dr. Luderitz, experimenting in the Hygienic Institute of Berlin, reported that no bacteria could resist the action of coffee
in infusion. He attributed this action not only to the tannin, which is present in high percentage, but principally to the
empyreumatic substances formed by the roasting. The caffeine takes no part in this action. Dr. Luderitz exposed the coffee
to the open air for six days and found it free from bacteria at the end of that time. Whatever may be the explanation of its
activity the fact remains that coffee is highly antiseptic, and this should be kept in mind by physicians not only because
it is everywhere easily obtained and an infusion easily prepared, but because it in addition possesses the great advantage
of being nontoxic.

<p>Caffeine, the only one of the ingredients that interests us, was discovered by Hunge in 1821 and recognized as an alkaloid
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147">147</a>]</span>by Herzog. It also exists in tea, formerly known as &#8220;theine&#8221; which is now known to be identical with caffeine; both are expressed
by the formula C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O. It crystallizes in fine, silky needles, is colorless, odorless and slightly bitter.

</p>
<p>It is considered a substitute for digitalis, especially valuable as a diuretic and where cerebral anemia exists. Germain See
values it as a preventive medicine, acting principally upon the heart and thus preventing fatigue; with this end in view he
advises its use before long marches, violent exercise and all conditions where the heart will be called upon to do a greatly
increased amount of work. Dose 0.25 gram to 1 or 2 grams a day given by stomach or hypodermic injection.

</p>
<p>Caffeine is also useful in headache, neuralgia, and asthma and as a general tonic. For the latter action it is best given
in pill form, 0.02&#8211;0.04 gram a day, with the extract of cinchona or other bitter tonic.

</p>
<p>&#8220;Etoxy-caffeine,&#8221; which is caffeine in which an atom of H has been replaced by the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O, exists as white, needle-like crystals, slightly soluble in water; it is narcotic and sedative to the cerebro-spinal system.
In doses of 0.24 gram it is useful in headache.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;This shrub is very common in gardens, well known by its pretty yellow, bell-shaped flowers. The trunk bark possesses antiperiodic
properties first described by Descourtilz and confirmed later by Dr. G. Bidie and Dr. J. Short. Both the latter used the tincture
in 10&#8211;15-drop doses 3 times a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160">160</a>]</span>day. This tincture was prepared by macerating for one week in 150 grams of alcohol 30 grams of fresh bark finely divided.
This preparation operates as an emetic and purgative in doses of 30&#8211;60 drops. It is evident that the plant possesses very
active, even poisonous properties and should be employed with great caution. The decoction of the bark is given as an emetic
and cathartic, but very imprudently because there is no means of determining the quantity of active principle, shown by chemical
analysis to be a dangerous product.

</p>
<p>The fruit is very bitter and acrid. The seeds yield by expression 35 to 41% oil (De Vry) and 57% when treated with benzol.
It has an agreeable odor resembling that of sweet almonds, its density is 0.9148 at 25&deg; and it is perfectly clear and transparent
at that temperature. At 15&deg; it thickens and at 13&deg; solidifies. According to Oudemans it consists of 63% triolein and 37% tripalmin
and tristearin; it is not poisonous. After expression De Vry obtained from the caked residue 4% of a crystalline glucoside
called by him <i>thevetin</i>. Blas, of the Academy of Medicine of Belgium, studied it later and described it as a white powder of small colorless scales,
odorless, very bitter, soluble at 14&deg; in 122 parts of water, in alcohol, in crystallizable acetic acid, insoluble in ether;
formula C<sub>54</sub>H<sub>34</sub>O<sub>24</sub>. Concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves it, producing a dark red color that changes to cherry red and then after several hours
to violet. The color disappears if water be added. Boiled in acid solution the glucoside changes to a new substance, <i>theveresin</i> (C<sub>48</sub>H<sub>70</sub>O<sub>17</sub>), white, amorphous, slightly soluble in boiling water and in alcohol, insoluble in benzine or chloroform, soluble in alkalies,
very bitter. Both substances are energetic narcotic poisons; but the plant contains another even more powerful poison isolated
by Warden, of Calcutta; it does not form crystals, it is very bitter, freely soluble in water, and is turned yellow by sulphuric
and nitric acids.

</p>
<p>Thevetin and theveresin exercise a marked toxic effect on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>heart. The former induces emetic and cathartic phenomena, trembling and progressive weakness. The latter does not cause vomiting
or diarrh&#339;a, but an&aelig;sthesia and rigidity of the limbs. Both poisons arrest the heart in systole. Injected hypodermically they
are irritant, are eliminated by the liver, but are not found in the urine.

<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;This tree, beloved for its fragrant flowers, has a wide therapeutic use in India and the Philippines. The bark is a bitter
hydragogue cathartic and is given in decoction (5&#8211;10 grams to 200 water) principally for dropsy; however the milky juice of
the trunk is preferable for this purpose, given in emulsion in doses of 0.50&#8211;0.80 grams. The bark and the tips of the branches
are given as an emmenagogue.

</p>
<p>The bark of the root and of the trunk is an excellent remedy for blenorrhagia. The fresh bark is thoroughly comminuted and
mixed with sweetened water in the proportion of 60 grams to 4 liters; this mixture is put in the sun for 4 days, and shaken
from time to time. It is then strained and given in doses of 4&#8211;5 glassfuls a day, at the same time with refreshing and emollient
drinks, and prolonged tepid baths. At first this preparation exerts a purgative action, but later acts upon the urinary organs,
rapidly lessening the suppurative process in urethritis. The bark may also be associated with wine or beer, in the proportion
of 30 grains to the liter, the dose being 2&#8211;4 small cupfuls a day and Dr. Grosourdy employs the extract of the bark in doses
aggregating 0.20&#8211;0.25 gram a day, gradually increased till at the end of a week 6 grams are taken daily (Dr. J. Amadeo).
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163">163</a>]</span></p>
<p>The bruised leaves are applied locally to contusions to reduce the swelling. The juice is used externally as a rubefacient
in rheumatic affections of the joints. In Concan they use a decoction of the root for diarrh&#339;a. The flower buds are chewed
with <i>buyo</i>, for intermittent fever and the juice is applied locally for itch.

</p>
<p>Peckolt and Geuther isolated from the bark the glucoside, <i>agoniadin</i> (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14</sub>O<sub>6</sub>), which crystallizes in silky crystals fusible at 155&deg;, slightly soluble in water, alcohol, bisulphuret of carbon, ether
and benzine; soluble in nitric or sulphuric acids. In solution it is a golden yellow soon changing to green. Boiled in a dilute
acid it splits into glucose and an undetermined substance. Oudeman obtained <i>plumieric</i> acid (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) from the milky juice deprived of its resin; the acid exists as microscopic, needle-like crystals, soluble in boiling water,
alcohol and ether. It melts and decomposes at 130&deg;.

<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The trunk bark is a febrifuge of great importance; it is official in the Pharmacop&#339;ia of India and is widely used <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164">164</a>]</span>in the Philippines. Personally I have had occasion to use it in several cases of malarial fever in the town of San Mateo near
Manila. It is astringent, anthelmintic and antiperiodic, highly useful in chronic diarrh&#339;a and dysentery, not only for its
astringent effects but for its tonic and restorative action. As a tonic it gives as good results as quinine. The dry powdered
bark is given internally in wafers of 20&#8211;30 centigrams. The infusion is prepared from 15 grams of the dry comminuted bark
to 300 of water. The dose is 30&#8211;60 grams 2 or 3 times a day.

</p>
<p>Another convenient preparation is the tincture, 75 grams of the powdered bark macerated 7 days in 500 grams of alcohol, shaking
from time to time. It is then filtered and enough alcohol added to make up the 500 cc. The dose is 4&#8211;8 grams a day.

</p>
<p>I have often used the following wine as a tonic for convalescents and patients suffering from general debility: Finely powdered
bark, 25 grams, muscatel or dry sherry one bottle; macerate a week, shaking every day, and filter; dose &frac12; wineglass with equal
parts water a few minutes before each meal; children or very weak patients should take it after eating; it should always be
diluted.

</p>
<p>G. Grupe, a Manila pharmacist, treating the bark in 1883 by the same process as that used in the preparation of quinine, obtained
a bitter substance which he named <i>Ditaine</i>. According to Grupe Dr. Pina used this substance with great success in the treatment of malarial fevers, but neither Grupe&#8217;s
report nor Pina&#8217;s experiment are of any scientific value, inasmuch as they have neglected to mention the doses in which the
so-called alkaloid was employed. Later analyses by Hesse and Jobst revealed several principles: two alkaloids <i>ditamine</i> (C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>19</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>), soluble in ether; <i>Ditaine</i> or <i>Echitamine</i> (C<sub>22</sub>H<sub>28</sub>NO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O) insoluble in ether, soluble in water; acetic acid and two amorphous substances dextrogyrous in ethereal solution, one of
them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165">165</a>]</span>a resin, <i>Echicauchina</i> (C<sub>25</sub>H<sub>40</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), the other neutral, <i>Echiretin</i> (C<sub>35</sub>H<sub>56</sub>O<sub>2</sub>); two crystallizable principles, dextrogyrous: <i>Echicerin</i> (C<sub>30</sub>H<sub>48</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), <i>Echitein</i> (C<sub>42</sub>H<sub>70</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and <i>Echitin</i> (C<sub>32</sub>H<sub>52</sub>O<sub>2</sub>).

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses</span>.&#8212;In the Philippines and in Spain this plant is well known to be poisonous. The bark and the leaves of both the red-flowered
and white-flowered varieties are boiled in cocoanut oil and the product is used for inunction in itch and other skin diseases.
The bruised root is a useful application for chancroids.

</p>
<p>We have stated that the plant is poisonous, and indeed it is actively so in the tropics. It is now recognized as an energetic
cardiac poison, comparable with strophanthus, destined to play <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166">166</a>]</span>an important part in therapeutics. Dr. Pouloux has made a study of the hydro-alcoholic extract of oleander and reports that
it exerts a marked effect on the heart of frogs and rabbits, arresting them in systole. Where there is asystolia, such as
we encounter in Bright&#8217;s disease, without compensation, it stimulates the heart and increases the urine in the same manner
as digitalis. No contraindications to its use are as yet known. It occasions no disagreeable symptoms and may be used many
days consecutively provided that the daily dose does not exceed 10&#8211;15 centigrams.

</p>
<p>The poisonous properties of the plant reside in two alkaloids isolated by Lukowsky from the leaves: <i>oleandrine</i>, extremely toxic and <i>pseudo-curarine</i>, as its name indicates, resembling curare in its action. Oleandrin is yellow, semicrystalline, soluble in water, alcohol,
ether, chloroform and olive oil; fusible at 70&#8211;75&deg; and changing to a greenish oil. With HCl it forms a crystalline salt. It
is a violent irritant of the mucous membranes and given internally it causes emesis, diarrh&#339;a, tetanic convulsions and death.
It arrests the cardiac movements in doses of 25 milligrams.

</p>
<p>Loiseleur-Deslongchamps experimented with the drug on his own person, using a solution of 30 grams of the extract in 120 grams
of wine. He began by taking three drops of this preparation four times a day, adding a drop to each dose every day, so that
at the end of 12 days he was taking 48 drops between 6 a. m. and 9 p. m. He reached a maximum of 64 drops a day but was forced
to abandon his experiment at that point on account of the unpleasant symptoms induced&#8212;loss of appetite, great weakness and
muscular pains. His deduction was that the plant contained a &#8220;destructive and irritant principle.&#8221; The experiment is of interest
as demonstrating the maximum dose of the drug.

</p>
<p>The active principles of the plant reside principally in the leaves and bark, but that they are abundantly present in other
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167">167</a>]</span>parts is proved by the death of several soldiers in Corsica from having eaten meat roasted on a spit of oleander wood.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;This plant is official in the Pharmacop&#339;ia of India as an alterative, tonic, diaphoretic and emetic. J. J. Durant, having
observed that the natives used it for dysentery, experimented with it quite successfully in that disease. For adults he gradually
raised the dose from 1.10 to 4 grams, preferring smaller doses, however, for mild cases. To children he prescribed 5&#8211;10 centigrams
for each year of age, 3 or 4 times a day. He remarked that the effects produced were identical with those of ipecac administered
in Brazilian fashion.

</p>
<p>The part of the plant used is the dry root powdered. The usual dose is 15&#8211;50 centigrams 3 times a day, gradually increased;
as an emetic 2&#8211;4 grams.

</p>
<p>The milky juice that escapes from the stem on the slightest abrasion is a drastic purgative, given commonly in dropsy, lumbricoids,
etc. Pledgets of cotton impregnated with the juice and packed in the cavities of carious teeth, relieve toothache. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168">168</a>]</span>It is applied locally for various skin diseases, including syphilitic ulcers, and as a depilatory.

</p>
<p>Some races of India, such as the Rajputs of the districts of Allahab and of Khangor, use this milk-juice to poison their female
infants whom they are accustomed to regard as a vexatious burden. Therapeutically they use it with honey, locally for sore
throat.

</p>
<p>The dry and powdered juice has been used in small doses as an alterative in the treatment of tuberculous leprosy, but it has
not given results any better than many other drugs. In syphilis and mercurial cachexia its results are less doubtful.

</p>
<p>In 1881 Dr. Riddell obtained a sort of gutta-percha from the juice, previously observed by Professor Redwood.

</p>
<p>Mooden Sheriff states that the most active parts of the plant are the root bark and the dried juice. He adds that the action
of the juice is irregular and even dangerous, and that the bark is active in direct proportion to its age. He recommends that
the inert tuberous layer of the bark be removed; prepared thus and powdered it is emetic in doses of 2.50&#8211;3 grams.

</p>
<p>Duncan claims to have isolated from the bark an active principle which he called <i>mudarin</i> from &#8220;mudar,&#8221; the Indian name of the plant. Following the same process Fl&uuml;ckiger was unable to obtain the substance, but
did isolate 1&frac12;% of an acrid resin, soluble in ether and in alcohol; a mucilage and a bitter principle decolorized by chloroform
and ether. It is probable that this is the active principle of the &#8220;Calotropis gigantea.&#8221;

</p>
<p>Warden and Waddell in 1881 isolated a substance crystallizable in nodular masses, with the formula C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>28</sub>O, analogous to the <i>albana</i> of gutta-percha.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses</span>.&#8212;We are ignorant of the uses the Filipinos make of this plant. It is official in the Pharmacop&#339;ia of India, the dry powdered
leaf being the part employed, and its emetic, diaphoretic and expectorant properties are well known in that country. Roxburgh
has used the root as an emetic and Anderson has employed it in the same manner as ipecac in dysentery. Later the experience
of Anderson was confirmed by O&#8217;Shaughnessy; though in place of the root he used the leaf, the properties of which he regards
as more certain and uniform.

</p>
<p>Dr. J. Kirkpatrick has noted that the juice of the root and its powder are used by the natives of Mysore as an emetic, and
adds that he himself has used it for that purpose in a thousand cases with good results. In its effect on dysentery as well
as in its emetic effect it resembles ipecacuanha. He used the powder in doses of 1.20&#8211;1.80 gr., to which he added 3&#8211;6 centigrams
of tartar emetic when he desired to obtain an energetic emetic action. Like O&#8217;Shaughnessy he prefers the powdered leaves.
He considers it a good substitute for ipecac, not only as an emetic, but as a remedy in asthma, dysentery and catarrhal affections;
Drs. Oswald and Mooden Sheriff have made the same observations. The latter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170">170</a>]</span>advises the administration of the juice of the plant for snake bites till vomiting is produced; then follow with diffusible
stimulants.

</p>
<p>The emetic dose of the powdered leaves is 1.20&#8211;1.80 grams, the expectorant and diaphoretic dose 10&#8211;30 centigrams. The concentrated
infusion of the leaves has an acrid taste. Tannic acid, the neutral acetate of lead and caustic potash produce with it an
abundant precipitate; the perchloride of iron colors it a dark green. Broughton, of Ootaemund (India), informed Hanbury and
Fl&uuml;ckiger, from whom we quote, that in 1872 he obtained a very small quantity of crystals from a large quantity of leaves.
He had not enough to make an analysis, but injected a solution of the crystals into a dog with resulting vomiting and diarrh&#339;a.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The part of the plant employed is the seed, known in addition to the above common names as Pepita de San Ignacio and Pepita
de Cabalonga (for <i>katbolog&#771;an</i>). The natives handle it with the greatest imprudence, selling everywhere in the markets and in the Chinese shops, called
<i>tindag&#771;-bayag&#771;</i>. It is not only a remedy among them, but a sort of panacea, to which they attribute, among other virtues, that of expelling
evil spirits, simply worn about the neck. They grate it with a piece of earthen pot, mix with a little &#8220;tuba&#8221; vinegar and
apply it to the temples for headache. In bites of poisonous animals they advise the application of the powdered seed over
the wound, a treatment which instead of being beneficent might easily be harmful to the patient. Before proceeding further,
let us give the chemical composition of the seeds in order that their uses may be the better understood.

</p>
<p><i>Strychnine</i> is found in them in the proportion of &frac12;&#8211;1&frac12; and <i>brucine</i> &frac12;%&#8211;1.4%. Fl&uuml;ckiger and Hanbury by drying it over sulphuric acid and burning it with &#8220;cal s&ograve;dica&#8221; obtained 1.78% of nitrogen
which represents 10% of albuminoid material. Strychnine and brucine exist in combination with igasuric acid discovered by
Ludwig in 1873. The proportion of both the alkaloids is greater than in the seeds of nux vomica which contain only .25&#8211;.50%
strychnine and .12&#8211;.05% brucin, although some authors give it as high as 1.01%. Strychnine can be obtained more readily and
in larger proportions from St. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172">172</a>]</span>Ignatius bean, but it is generally obtained from nux vomica seeds on account of the cheapness of the latter.

</p>
<p>It is more energetic than nux vomica and its use in medicine should be condemned, preference, however, being given to the
official preparations among which the best known is that commonly called &#8220;Bitter Drops of Beaum&eacute;,&#8221; of which the following
is the composition:

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Botanical Description.</span>&#8212;This plant grows in the deep forests of Samar and Masbate. That industrious and distinguished botanist, D. Regino Garc&iacute;a,
found it growing abundantly in Paranas, Island of Samar. It is a robust vine, the trunk sometimes as thick as a man&#8217;s thigh,
climbing to the tops of the highest trees, apparently without preference as to its host, inasmuch as he saw it growing indifferently
on <i>Ficus</i>, <i>Dipterocarpus</i>, <i>Litsaca</i>, etc. The seed which most interests us and is very common, is about the size of an olive, round and convex on one side, angulose
and flattened on the other by being compressed with many others within the fruit which contains 50 of them. Its surface is
blackish with a gray-blue tinge. It is hard and corneous. Its taste is extremely bitter.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;In the Philippines the entire plant is boiled and used for food, with the precaution of pouring off the first 2 or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177">177</a>]</span>3 waters in which it is cooked, which contain an active principle capable of causing such disagreeable symptoms as vertigo
and nausea. A decoction of the leaves serves to cleanse chronic sores and in fact improves their condition; it is also used
as a lotion for various forms of dermatitis, for erysipelas and old burns.

</p>
<p>The plant is narcotic, antispasmodic and like belladonna it dilates the pupil.

</p>
<p>In India the decoction is given internally, 200&#8211;250 grams, for hypertrophy of the liver, and it is considered a good diuretic
and alterative. For such uses they heat the above dose in a clay vessel till the color changes from green to brown, when it
is cooled and given next day. Its action is diuretic and hydragogue-cathartic. Mooden Sheriff recommends this treatment highly,
and for dropsy further advises the aqueous extract, 12 grams during the day divided into 3 or 4 doses. Small doses of 30&#8211;60
grams of the decoction prepared as above described, are of use in some chronic skin diseases such as psoriasis.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The applications of this species are identical with those of <i>D. Stramonium</i> and it is official in the Pharmacop&#339;ia of India. It is antispasmodic, narcotic and toxic, and is used quite commonly with
criminal intent in India and Indo-China. The cooked and bruised leaves make an efficient poultice in articular rheumatism.

</p>
<p>The symptoms of poisoning by &#8220;dhatura&#8221; are: dilatation of the pupil, general malaise, dryness of the fauces and skin, hallucinations,
rapid pulse, coma and death or permanent mania.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179">179</a>]</span></p>
<p>The dry leaf is smoked to abort asthma, and though its action is uncertain, it is one of the many remedies that should be
tried, which though ineffective in one case may in another afford positive relief in this distressing disease. Not more than
1.50 grams should be smoked in one day and their use should be discontinued if any symptom of intoxication supervenes. The
Pharmacop&#339;ia of India contains a tincture made from 75 grams of the ground seeds and 500 grams of alcohol. Dr. Waring states
that 20 drops of this tincture are equivalent to 6 centigrams of opium and that in some cases it has given him better narcotic
results than the opium. The extract is made from 500 grams of the powdered seeds, 500 cc. ether, 500 cc. alcohol and 500 cc.
water. Dose, 5&#8211;20 centigrams a day in 4 doses.

</p>
<p>The <i>D. fastuosa</i>, L., known in Manila by the common name of <i>Talamponay na itim</i>, Tag., possesses the same properties as the above. The Filipino physician, Sr. Zamora, successfully employed a poultice of
bruised leaves cooked in vinegar and applied to the forehead and backs of the hands to reduce the fever of tuberculous patients.

</p>
<p>Neither the leaves nor seeds of these two varieties of <i>Datura</i> have been studied from a chemical standpoint, but there is little doubt that the active principle is the <i>daturine</i> (atropine and hyoscyamine) that exists so abundantly in <i>D. Stramonium</i>.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Botanical Description.</span>&#8212;Plant 5&#8211;6&deg; high, with nodose branches, forked. Leaves ovate, angled, somewhat downy. Flowers large, white, axillary, solitary.

<p><b>Nicotiana Tabacum, L.</b>

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Nom. Vulg.</span>&#8212;<i>Tabaco</i>, Sp.; <i>Tobacco</i>, Eng.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;Tobacco is a powerful sedative and antispasmodic, but owing to the accidents it may give rise to, its use in therapeutics
is very limited. Like all the active Solanace&aelig; it is effective against neuralgia and spasm of the muscular tissues and is
therefore indicated in strangulated hernia and in intestinal obstruction. In these conditions the infusion of 1&#8211;5 grams of
the dried leaf to 250 grams of water is given by enema. Trousseau advises non-smokers who suffer from chronic constipation
to smoke a cigarette fasting, a practice which, according to him, stimulates defecation. For the same condition the people
of southern India are accustomed to apply a poultice of the bruised leaves to the anal region.

</p>
<p>Tobacco has been used by enema to combat tetanus; Dr. Lesth, of the General Hospital for Europeans, Bombay, claims to have
obtained excellent results by applying a poultice over the entire length of the spinal column. Dr. Dymock has confirmed this
practice.

</p>
<p>A decoction of the leaves is used as a lotion to destroy &#8220;pediculi capitis and pubis,&#8221; and to wash gangrenous ulcers.

</p>
<p>The daily increasing practice of smoking, like all other subjects, divides mankind into two camps, one for and one against
the habit. Both parties exaggerate their arguments. The abuse of the plant without doubt sets up disturbances of the digestion,
the heart and the nervous system. It is furthermore positive that persons of a certain disposition and with certain ailments
are injured by even a moderate use of tobacco. The above facts serve as arms for the opponents of the habit; the robust who
smoke and drink to excess and meet with an accidental death on a railroad or from an acute disease that overtakes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181">181</a>]</span>them in the midst of perfect health, serve as arguments for the defenders, to prove the innocence of the custom. The antiseptic
qualities of the smoke and of the entire plant also lend the smoker a defensive argument, as he may uphold the habit as hygienic
and highly useful in preventing microbic infection. The antiseptic power of tobacco smoke is undoubted, but it is intolerable
that a physician under the pretext of avoiding self infection should enter the house of his patient and continue smoking at
the bedside.

</p>
<p>Chronic nicotine poisoning is the result of a gradual intoxication by the absorption of the active principle of tobacco, the
alkaloid nicotine. Excessive smoking conduces to nicotism, more common in Europe than in the tropics, because the natives
of Europe smoke the pipe and being confined in closed dwellings, breathe continuously an atmosphere of smoke; in the Philippines,
on the contrary, the pipe is almost unknown and owing to the nature of the dwellings the smoking is carried on practically
in the open air. An injurious practice of the Filipino smokers is that of &#8220;swallowing the smoke,&#8221; and this is a fitting point
to call attention to an error of Dujardin-Beaumetz, who states that &#8220;in those who habitually swallow the smoke the nicotine
acts directly upon the stomach.&#8221; The expression &#8220;swallow smoke&#8221; (<span lang="es">tragar el humo</span>) does not mean to force it into the stomach by an act of deglutition, and I am sure no one attempts to dispose of it in that
way; but to inspire or breath it into the air passages. It is evident that this latter habit does not involve the stomach,
but those who practice it expose themselves more to nicotism than those who keep the smoke in the mouth or expel it through
the nose.

</p>
<p>The first cigar causes symptoms familiar to nearly everybody; dizziness, malaise, cold sweat, vomiting, diarrh&#339;a, dilatation
of the pupils and rapid heart action&#8212;an acute intoxication. Chronic intoxication or nicotism manifests itself by disturbances
of digestion, vision and especially circulation. It has been assigned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182">182</a>]</span>as one of the causes of early atheroma and of angina pectoris. It should therefore be proscribed in persons who present symptoms
of gastro-intestinal or of heart disease, and in every patient who complains of slight precordial pains, commonly attributed
to flatus, but in reality cardiac neuralgia, a fugitive symptom announcing the possibility of that grave accident, angina
pectoris, capable of ending the life of the patient with one stroke.

</p>
<p>Nicotine (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14</sub>N<sub>2</sub>) is an oleaginous liquid heavier than water, colorless, changing to dark yellow on contact with the air. <i>Nicotianin</i> or &#8220;camphor of tobacco&#8221; is another substance found in the leaves, crystalline, tasteless, with an odor resembling tobacco.
Nicotinic acid is a product of the combustion of nicotine.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Botanical Description.</span>&#8212;The tobacco plant is so familiar to all Americans that its description here would be superfluous. It grows in all parts of
the islands, the best qualities being cultivated in the northern provinces of Luzon, especially Cagayan and La Isabela.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The Filipinos are but slightly familiar with this plant and it has no place in their therapeutical armamentarium. In India,
however, it is very common and enjoys much reputation in the treatment of catarrhs, the grip, asthma and non-febrile, especially
chronic, bronchial affections. The flowers, leaves and roots, but especially the flowers, possess antispasmodic properties
and are prescribed in certain forms of asthma; they are bitter and slightly aromatic, and are given in infusion or electuary.

</p>
<p>Drs. Jackson and Dott have testified from their own experience to the usefulness of the drug in chronic bronchitis, asthma
and afebrile catarrh. Dr. Watt states that the natives of Bengal find relief for asthma in smoking the leaves. In Bombay its
expectorant action is commonly known and its juice is used, mixed with borax and honey.

</p>
<p>The dose of the aqueous extract made by evaporating the juice of the leaves, is .25&#8211;1 gram. The tincture is preferable, made

<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The plant has much reputation in India in the treatment of skin diseases, and indeed its efficiency is great in the stubborn
<i>Tinea circinata tropica</i>, known throughout the Orient as &#8220;dhobie-itch.&#8221; In this disease it is applied for several days to the affected part in the
form of a paste composed of the bruised leaves, the juice of the leaves and lemon juice. The fresh root also may be employed.
The Hindoo physicians state that the root decoction in milk is aphrodisiac; the root is also regarded as an antidote for the
bite of the &#8220;cobra da cabelho,&#8221; but its virtue is purely imaginary. Of late years the plant has been used in Europe under
the name of &#8220;tong-pang-chong,&#8221; to treat chronic eczema.

</p>
<p>Liborius made an analysis of the root in the laboratory of Dorpat, separating 13.51% ash and 1.87% <i>rhinocanthin</i>, as well as other ingredients. Rhinocanthin (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>18</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) is supposed to be the active principle of the root. It is analogous to quinon and resembles in many particulars chrysophanic
and frangulic acids. It forms a resinous, amorphous mass, cherry red, odorless and tasteless, slightly soluble in water, forming
a mildly alkaline solution in alcohol. It does not yield glucose when boiled with dilute hydrochloric acid. Liborius believes
that it exists only in the intercellular spaces of the &#8220;root bark.&#8221;

A decoction of the powder gives good results as a gargle for aphth&aelig;, gingivitis, and other inflammations within the buccal
cavity. In India they give internally 6&#8211;12 grams as a vermifuge, and for dyspepsia with &#8220;heartburn.&#8221;

</p>
<p>The flowers are diuretic according to Endlicher; the bark is astringent; the leaves and the seeds are purgative, the latter
yielding an oil which they use in India to stimulate the growth of the hair. Gibson considers the seeds diuretic and quotes
two cases where abundant diuresis immediately followed by the application of a poultice of the bruised seeds over the pubis.
In Concan they make a sort of extract from the wood and apply it to the yoke sores of the cattle to prevent the growth of
maggots. This disinfectant action marks the plant as worthy of further experiment.

</p>
<p>Rumphius is authority for the statement that the infusion of the leaves is used in cholera. The Chinese make vessels of the
wood to preserve their drinking water at sea; the first and second waters are bitter and are thrown away, but after that the
water has no disagreeable taste and is said to aid digestion.

</p>
<p>It has been said that the wood was poisonous because at one time several workmen died from the effects of wounds caused by
splinters of the wood, but the statement has not been confirmed by later cases and the deaths were most probably due to a
septic infection independent of the chemical composition of the splinters.

</p>
<p>R. Romanis has extracted a resin from the wood by alcohol; it is soft, and on distillation yields a crystalline body called
by the author <i>tectoquinon</i> (C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), on account of its resemblance to the quinons. It melts at 171&deg; and volatilizes slightly at ordinary temperature.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;Both species are used medicinally in the Philippines and both enjoy high repute. A variety of the first that seems to possess
the same virtues is the <i>V. repens</i>, Blanco, called <i>lagundig&#771; gapag&#771;</i> by the Tagalos.

</p>
<p><i>V. trifolia</i> is regarded in India as the most powerful species and Bontius has extolled it highly, calling attention to the anodyne, diuretic
and emmenagogue properties of the leaves. These are very effective applied in fomentation to rheumatic joints and their use
is extensive both in India and the Malay Archipelago. A decoction of the leaves is used locally and as a vapor-bath in the
treatment of beriberi. A large earthen pot is filled with leaves and water and brought to a boil; the pot is then placed under
a chair in which the patient sits enveloped <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193">193</a>]</span>in a sheet or blanket. If necessary the pot may be removed 2 or 3 times, heated and replaced until abundant sweating is induced.
An apparatus to conduct the steam under the chair would be much handier, but it is unsafe to place a small stove or lamp under
the chair for fear of setting fire to the cloth.

</p>
<p>In India and the Philippines there is a peculiar inflammation localized in the soles of the feet and characterized by an intense
burning rather than pain, not described in the textbooks, but called by the natives &#8220;burning of the feet&#8221; (&#8220;quemadura del
pi&eacute;&#8221; or &#8220;ignipedites&#8221;); in our own experience and according to the consensus of the physicians of India, the application of
these leaves 3 or 4 times a day to the soles of the feet has afforded marked relief. The leaves are heated in an earthen pot
without the addition of water, and when sufficiently hot are applied and held in place by a bandage.

</p>
<p>Dr. W. Ingledew states that the natives of Mysore (south of India) treat rheumatism and febrile catarrhs by steam baths of
the decoction of vitex. A decoction of the leaves is in common use in the Philippines, Malay Islands and India as a bath for
women in the puerperal state.

</p>
<p>The dry leaves are smoked for headache and catarrh. According to creditable authority the application of the heated leaves
in orchitis produces good results. The root is tonic, febrifuge and expectorant and the fruit nervine and emmenagogue according
to the Sanscrit writer.

<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;All three species possess a characteristic camphoraceous odor and are commonly grouped under the one name, <i>albahacas</i> (sweet basil). Some natives call them <i>solasi</i> and others <i>balanay</i>, but many are able to distinguish the various species correctly. All three have analogous properties, but the most widely
used is the <i>O. basilicum</i>. These properties are stimulant, diaphoretic, and expectorant, and the infusion is used commonly for flatulent colic and
painful dyspepsia. The dry powdered leaves of the <i>O. sanctum</i> are taken as snuff by the natives of India in the treatment of a curious endemic disease characterized by the presence of
small maggots in the nasal secretion; this disease is called peenash, and possibly exists in the Philippines though I have
never encountered it.

</p>
<p>Martins states that in Brazil they use a decoction of the mucilaginous leaves of the <i>O. gratissimum</i> in the treatment of gonorrh&#339;a and Dr. Waitz highly recommends a strong decoction of these leaves for the aphth&aelig; of children,
which he claims to have cured by this means after all European drugs had failed. This fact and the action of the snuff above
mentioned, demonstrate the antiseptic properties of the plant, due doubtless to its abundant aromatic principles.

</p>
<p><i>O. basilicum</i> contains a green essential oil, very aromatic, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196">196</a>]</span>becoming solid; it is a sort of camphor (C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>16</sub>6HO, Raybaud) and crystallizes in 4-faced prisms.

<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;This plant is a native of Mexico. It has a peculiar, somewhat offensive odor and an acrid, aromatic taste due to an essential
oil resembling peppermint (?). According to Padre Mercado, &#8220;When the seeds are taken with wine, sensation is so dulled that
the drinker may be whipped without feeling the lashes, and even if put to the torment, does not feel it.&#8221; These properties,
if true, make this plant one of the most useful in the Philippines. The entire plant is stimulant. The infusion, given internally,
causes sweating, excites the circulation, is diuretic, tonic, stomachic, and useful as well as an antispasmodic in nervous
troubles. The leaves are employed in making the infusion, 8 grams to 200 of boiling water. It is widely used in bronchial
catarrhs and in asthma on account of its sudorific and expectorant action. It seems also to possess emmenagogue properties.
The seeds yield on distillation a yellow essential oil with a strong and disagreeable odor, density 0.908. Both seeds and
flowers are vermifuge, and are used as such in Brazil in doses of 8 grams in infusion or with an equal dose of castor oil.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The root has a wide use in medicine in the Philippines; it is bitter, of a nauseating odor and has the reputation of being
a powerful antidote for the bites of poisonous serpents and insects. It has further use in the treatment of malarial fever,
in dyspepsia, and in the flatulent colic of teething children. It is regarded as tonic and emmenagogue. In various forms of
diarrh&#339;a it appears to be effective and Dr. Gibson states that it is useful in intestinal disorders. In the Philippines it
is not only given internally but also externally applied over the abdomen, mixed with hot cocoanut oil (10 grams of the powdered
root to 100 oil).
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204">204</a>]</span></p>
<p>The first Portuguese settlers in India called the drug &#8220;Cobra Root,&#8221; because the natives regarded it as an antidote for the
bite of the terrible &#8220;Cobra da Capello.&#8221; This reputation, however, seems not to have been deserved, judging from the fearful
mortality in India and Ceylon due to the bite of the cobra.

</p>
<p>Dr. Imlach, a surgeon of Singapore, states that in one season in one collectorate, Shikapore, no less than 306 cases of snake
bites were officially reported, the mortality being 63, or about 20.58 per cent. Other reports make it safe to conclude that
in the entire province during the year no less than 300 deaths were due to this cause alone. Dr. Waring believes that if an
antidote for snake bite exist in the vegetable kingdom it will most probably be found in the natural order Aristolochiace&aelig;.

</p>
<p>In North India this drug is used as emmenagogue and anti-arthritic, and in Banda for intermittent fevers and intestinal disorders.
The juice of the leaves is emetic. The dose of the powdered root is 3&#8211;5 grams daily.

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205">205</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses</span>.&#8212;A masticatory, used all over the extreme Orient, is composed of the leaves of this plant, a little slaked oyster-shell lime
and a rounded slice of the bonga or areca nut; the Filipinos call this combination <i>bayo</i>, though the name is not of native origin; the Tagalos call it <i>hits&uacute;</i>. The use of buyo by careless persons is decidedly repugnant, for the mixture of the lime and the pigment of the bonga imparts
a blood-red or rather brick-red color to the saliva which they spit in mouthfuls into the streets and other public places
with no thought of the feelings of others. Unless the mouth is carefully cleaned the teeth become encrusted with a sort of
black enamel and the breath assumes a detestable odor. When used in small quantities and with proper toilet of the mouth,
and this is the common practice among the Filipinos, buyo seems to be a very useful preservative of the teeth and a gingival
and stomachic tonic. These properties are readily understood when we consider that the lime is antacid, the bonga astringent
and tonic and the betel aromatic and stimulant.

</p>
<p>The buyo leaf plays a very important part in the therapeutics of the infant of the Philippines: in its indigestions, colics
and diarrh&#339;as the heated leaves are applied to the abdomen previously anointed with hot cocoanut oil. In bronchitis and laryngitis
the heated leaves are applied over the chest or neck after rubbing the parts with oil. It undoubtedly produces good effects
and the physicians of India recommend it in the same cases and in the same form as in the Philippines. Applied to the breasts
of parturient women it dries up the milk and in the same way tends to reduce any glandular enlargement.

</p>
<p>Dr. Kleinst&uuml;ck of Java recommends the essence of the leaves in all sorts of catarrhs and as an antiseptic in doses of one
drop to 140 of the vehicle. This essence is obtained by distillation; it is dark in color, has an acrid taste and an odor
resembling that of tea. Its density is 1.020. The dried leaves contain one-half per cent. of the essence and it is probable
that the fresh ones contain a greater proportion.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses</span>.&#8212;The berry-like fruit of the pepper is more extensively used as a condiment in cooking than in the treatment of disease.
Used in moderation, however, it is of considerable value as a convenient stomachic and aid to digestion in tropical countries
where the digestive functions readily become sluggish. Its abuse may lead to serious consequences, such as inflammation of
the gastro-intestinal mucous membrane, of the portal system and the liver itself.

</p>
<p>Pepper is used as a febrifuge in the various forms of malarial fevers, in the form of granules of 8 or 10 berries in a cup
of brandy and anise (Spanish); this is taken by the patient in one dose at the beginning of the cold stage and followed by
large quantities of water to relieve the thirst caused by the pepper. This treatment causes the cold stage to rapidly subside
and more rapidly induces and intensifies the sweating stage. It is said that no further attack of fever follows.

</p>
<p>Piperin (C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>19</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>) is febrifuge and is given in pill form internally in doses of 30&#8211;60 centigrams; the action of the crude drug is evidently
due to this neutral principle.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses</span>.&#8212;The principal medicinal use of this plant in the Philippines is the introduction of the hot juice of its fleshy leaves into
the external auditory canal in cases of otorrh&#339;a or of simple earache, whatever its cause.

</p>
<p>The root is regarded in India as an antidote for snake bite and, indeed, the plant is sacred to Munsa, the snake divinity.
During the months of July and August in some parts of India the natives make offerings of rice, milk and sugar to this sacred
tree every Tuesday and Thursday, praying for protection from the bites of serpents.

</p>
<p>The leaves contain an abundance of milky juice, acrid and very active, used in the treatment of several skin diseases. Like
the species <i>E. pilulifera</i> it possesses antiasthmatic properties; Dr. S. C. Amcobury reports 6 cases treated with satisfactory results. Owing to the
acrid quality of the juice great care should be maintained both in its internal and external use. The Sanscrit authors regard
it as purgative and usually administer <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213">213</a>]</span>it with other drugs of the same action to increase its effect. Ainslie states that the native herb-doctors of India give the
juice in intestinal obstruction and in the &#339;dema of malarial cachexia. The dose is 1.25 grams in 24 hours given in 300 cc.
of sweetened water in divided doses. This dose is, in my opinion, dangerous; 40&#8211;60 centigrams a day is more prudent.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses</span>.&#8212;The milky juice of the trunk and branches is a drastic purgative, too active for safety as a physic. Mixed with water it
is used as a wash for atonic ulcers.

</p>
<p>The seeds yield 25&#8211;30 per cent. of a yellowish oil, more active than castor oil as a purgative but less certain. Ten or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216">216</a>]</span>twelve of the former equal in effect 30 to 40 drops of the latter. Its density is 0.919, and it differs from castor oil in
being only slightly soluble in absolute alcohol. In some parts of the Philippines it is used for purposes of illumination,
and it is exported to Europe to adulterate soaps and candles. It contains a little stearin which begins to be deposited at
9&deg; and is entirely solidified at 0&deg;.

</p>
<p>The fruit is strongly purgative, and this action is not due to the oil but to a peculiar resin so active that 3 fruits produce
drastic effects. Whatever purgative action the oil possesses is due to the resin which it contains in solution. It seems,
therefore, preferable to treat the seeds with alcohol, thus dissolving the resin, and use the tincture thus obtained in place
of the oil.

</p>
<p>The natives use the plant to intoxicate the fish in ponds and sluggish streams.

</p>
<p>The seeds of the species <i>J. multifida</i>, L., also called <i>tuba</i> in Tag., and <i>mana</i>, are likewise purgative in their action. Dr. Waring saw a case of poisoning with the fruit; the patient, a young man, suffered
violent vomiting, intense pain in the stomach and head, and marked prostration. He recovered under the use of lime juice and

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;This plant is not used medicinally in the Philippines, but is very common in India. Dr. G. Bidie, of Madras, states that
the expressed juice of the leaves is in great repute, wherever the plant grows, as an emetic for children and is safe, certain
and speedy in its action. Like ipecacuanha it seems to have little tendency to act on the bowels or depress the vital powers,
and it decidedly increases the secretion of the pulmonary organs. Probably an infusion of the dried leaves or an extract prepared
from the green plant would retain all its active properties. The dose of the expressed juice for an infant is a teaspoonful.

</p>
<p>Dr. A. E. Ross speaks highly of its use as an expectorant, ranking it in this respect with senega; he found it especially
useful in the bronchitis of children. He also makes favorable report of a cataplasm of the leaves as a local application to
syphilitic ulcers and as a means of relieving the pain attendant on the bites of venomous insects.

</p>
<p>The alleged purgative action of the root noticed by Ainslie is confirmed by Dr. H. E. Busteed, who reports having used the
expressed juice of the root and leaves as a laxative for children.

</p>
<p>Langley, a military surgeon, states that in Canara the natives employ the leaf juice in congestive headache, soaking pledgets
of cotton with it and introducing them into the nasal foss&aelig;; the resultant nose bleed relieves the headache. The powder of
the dry leaves is dusted on ulcers and putrid sores. In asthma <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220">220</a>]</span>and bronchitis, both of children and adults, Langley has used this plant with good results, and he recommends 1.25&#8211;3.50 grams
of the tincture (100 grams of the fresh plant to 500 of alcohol, 90&deg;) repeated several times a day; the effect is expectorant,
nauseant and, in large doses, emetic.

<p>It must be noted that only the young, growing plants are active.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The capsular fruit of this plant is thickly beset with reddish glands and hairs, which, when brushed off and gathered in
powder form, constitute the <i>kamala dye</i> of the Hindoos. It was mentioned by the Arabian physicians of the tenth century under the names of <i>Kanbil</i> and <i>Wars</i>. In India the powder is highly valued as a yellow dye-stuff for silk. Medicinally it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221">221</a>]</span>is used as an anthelmintic, the English physician Mackinnon, of the Bengal Hospital, having been the first to scientifically
prove this property; he reported that it was successful in expelling the tape-worm. It is now official in the Pharmacop&#339;ia
of India and also in the U. S. P. as an anthelmintic and purgative; in Switzerland it is commonly given to expel the bothriocephalus
which abounds there, the lake fish acting as hosts.

</p>
<p>The dose recommended by the Pharmacop&#339;ia of India is 8&#8211;12 grams, divided in 3 or 4 doses. This amount sometimes causes nausea
and colic; in the third or fourth stool the t&aelig;nia is commonly expelled in a lifeless condition. Dujardin-Beaumetz advises
a dose of 30 grams of castor oil in case the t&aelig;nia has not been expelled 2 hours after the last dose of kamala. The powder
is efficacious but the tincture seems to be surer; the dose is 6 grams for children and 20 for adults, given in divided doses
in aromatic water every hour for 6 hours. This tincture is prepared by macerating 200 grams of kamala in 500 cc. alcohol for
7 days; then filtering with expression and adding enough alcohol to complete the 500 cc.

</p>
<p>The powder is also used in India as a local application in herpes circinata. It is insoluble in water; in ether and alcohol
it yields 80% of a red resin. Anderson noted that a concentrated ethereal solution of kamala after a few days formed a solid
crystalline mass, yellow, very soluble in ether; this substance he named <i>rottlerin</i>, C<sub>11</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses</span>.&#8212;A purgative oil is expressed from the seeds, called &#8220;<span lang="es">Aceite de Ricino</span>&#8221; (castor oil). It operates mechanically in the intestinal tract and its action is rapid and is indicated whenever it is desired
simply to empty the intestines without producing any irritating effect; it is, therefore, a purgative indicated in diseases
of children, in pregnancy, and in hemorrhoidal congestions where a non-irritating evacuation of the rectum is desired. It
is an anthelmintic, though not ordinarily given alone, but in combination with other drugs of a purely anthelmintic action,
the object being to expel the worms which have been attacked by the specific.

</p>
<p>Oil extracted simply by expression is less purgative than that obtained by treating the seeds with bisulphide of carbon and
absolute alcohol; also less purgative than the seeds themselves, because it contains only a very small proportion of a drastic
principle existing exclusively in the seeds; this principle is completely dissolved in the oil extracted by chemical process.

</p>
<p>It is pale yellow in color, very viscid, with a characteristic mouldy odor. The purgative dose is 10&#8211;30 grams. A small dose
may purge as actively as a larger one provided that the patient drink abundantly after the administration of the drug. The
best method of disguising its taste is by giving it in half a cup of very strong, hot coffee. Just before the dose, take a
swallow of coffee to disguise the taste even more effectually.

sweet preserves. The arils and pulpy envelopes of the seeds are the parts eaten, also the seeds themselves, boiled or roasted.
According to Padre Mercado the roasted seeds have an aphrodisiac action.

</p>
<p>The heated and powdered leaves are applied to wounds and given internally for congestions. The resin of the trunk is a useful
application to ulcers and in India they give it internally <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224">224</a>]</span>to cure la melena, the dose, one &#8220;tola&#8221; mixed with the same amount of <i>manga</i> resin and a little lime water. The same resin if heated makes an excellent cement for broken china.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Botanical Description</span>.&#8212;A tree, 20&deg; or more in height, with abundant milky sap. Leaves alternate, oval, acute at both ends, slightly wavy and revolute
borders, tough, glabrous and dark green upper surface; light green, slightly rough under surface. Petioles short. Flowers
greenish, mon&#339;cious, growing on root, trunk and branches. Calyx very small, monophyllous, of about 7 deciduous lobules. Staminate:

<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses</span>.&#8212;The Padre Mercado writes as follows concerning the properties of this plant: &#8220;The leaves, applied with salt in the form
of a plaster, purify dog bites, foul, putrid, malignant and cankerous ulcers; they cure boils, contusions and all abscesses;
mixed with wax they may be applied for obstruction of the spleen; mashed with the juice and inserted in the nose they arrest
nose-bleed; cooked with snails they soften the stomach, excite the secretion of urine and dissipate flatus; the juice given
as a gargle aborts inflammation of the epiglottis. The seeds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225">225</a>]</span>mixed with wine are a sexual excitant and &#8220;clear out&#8221; the womb; taken with syrup they relieve dyspn&#339;a, pain in the side and
inflammation of the lungs and force up the humors from the chest; it may be mixed with medicines that corrupt the flesh (sic).
The grated root drunk with wine relieves painful flatulence. I myself (continues the Padre Mercado) have experimented with
a woman who suffered with painful flatulence and this remedy relieved her.&#8221;

</p>
<p>We repeat that all the foregoing is copied from the writings of Padre Mercado and we offer it as a therapeutic curiosity.

</p>
<p>P. Blanco states that merely to touch the leaves causes an intolerable itching.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses</span>.&#8212;The fruit produced by the various varieties of the banana plant constitutes one of the most wholesome and delicious of foods,
appreciated by natives and Europeans alike. According to Boussingaul its nutritive value is greater than that of the potato
and it may be used constantly without ill effects. Bananas contain a large percentage of sugar and mucilage. In India they
dry them in the sun, as figs and grapes are treated in other countries and thus preserve them for long voyages by sea or land;
eaten in conjunction with animal food they are a strong preventive of scurvy. If eaten when thoroughly ripe they have a laxative
effect.

</p>
<p>The young and tender leaves are used in the Philippines as a protective dressing for ulcers, dermatitis, burns and cantharidal
or other artificial blisters. Before applying to the affected surface the leaf is heated to make it more flexible and coated
with a thin layer of cocoanut oil or other fatty substance.

</p>
<p>In the dispensaries of India they also use the leaves in this way, thus protecting and at the same time maintaining the moisture
of the part. Dr. Waring recommends the practice and Dr. Van Someren follows it in the application of water dressings, having
substituted banana leaves for gutta-percha.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228">228</a>]</span></p>
<p>In Mauritius the fruit is used for dysentery, and the flowers, together with an equal quantity of those of <i>Spilanthes Acmella</i>, are made into a decoction and prescribed for dropsy.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Botanical Description</span>.&#8212;The banana plant with its huge waving leaves and succulent stem is universally familiar. The flower stalk rises through
the center developing a drooping spike, the flowers in short rows in the axils of its large purplish bracts. According to
Blanco there are 57 varieties of this plant in the Philippines, the following being the most common edible varieties: <i>bug&#771;ulag&#771;</i>, <i>lakatan</i>, <i>letondag&#771;</i>, <i>obispo</i>, <i>higo</i>, <i>morado</i>, <i>butuan</i>, <i>bentikohol</i>, <i>sab&aacute;</i>, <i>tampuhig&#771;</i>.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses</span>.&#8212;The rhizome is used principally as a condiment in the Philippines. Its flavor is extremely agreeable, much appreciated in
Europe by the English who are the greatest consumers of the condiment. In the Philippines a decoction is made of ginger and
brown sugar, called <i>tahu</i> by the Chinese who drink it regularly as we do coffee in the early hours of the morning. It is an excellent drink, aromatic,
tonic, stomachic and stimulant, and would probably be highly useful as well as economical as a part of the ration of European
and native troops in the field. Hot <i>tah&uacute;</i> or <i>tahu</i> is an active diuretic; and during the last epidemic of cholera in Manila some physicians used it with very satisfactory results.

</p>
<p>Ginger is a good carminative and is official in the pharmacop&#339;ias of Europe, America and India. It is used with good effect
in flatulent colic, atonic diseases of the intestines so common in the Philippines and in chronic rheumatism.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229">229</a>]</span></p>
<p>The tincture is given in doses of 2&#8211;4 grams. The official infusion 30&#8211;60 grams.

</p>
<p>The rhizome contains a volatile oil<a class="noteref" id="xd0e12398src" href="#xd0e12398">1</a> (25 per cent.), a pale yellow liquid, specific gravity 0.878, the odor like that of the rhizome but lacking its strong and
piquant taste. Its reaction is not acid; it dissolves slowly in alcohol. The burning taste is due to a resin that produces
protocatechuic acid when melted with potassa.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Botanical Description</span>.&#8212;The only part employed is the rhizome, well known all over the islands and found in all their pharmacies and shops.

</p>
<p>Several stems rise 2&#8211;3&deg; directly from the peculiar, branched rhizome; long-lanceolate, acuminate, entire, glabrous, alternate
leaves diverge stiffly from the sides of the stem; petiole proper very short, its broader extension ensheathing the stem;
general appearance of a single stem is much like that of the Solomon&#8217;s seal so familiar in the U. S.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses</span>.&#8212;The yellow rhizome called by some <i>azafr&aacute;n</i> (saffron), is used as a condiment; its odor is remotely suggestive of vanilla. The Philippine herb-doctors give it internally
for h&aelig;moptysis, externally as a plaster or in infusion for acute dermatitis. The juice is prescribed in doses of 30&#8211;60 grams
in bronchial catarrh. In India they inhale the fumes of burning turmeric paper for coryza, and with good effect according
to the testimony of Dr. Waring.

</p>
<p>The drug is official in the Pharmacop&#339;ia of India. It is carminative, stimulant and probably antiseptic. Its decoction is
used as an eye-wash in catarrhal and purulent conjunctivitis. The Mohammedans of <span class="corr" id="xd0e12444" title="Source: Decan">Deccan</span> use it for jaundice upon the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230">230</a>]</span>theory that the yellow color of the skin in that disease is an indication for a remedy of the same color. The juice is also
used in many parts of India to stain the face, nails and other parts of the body.

</p>
<p>The tincture is prepared by macerating 30 grams of bruised rhizome in 200 cc. alcohol for seven days, then filtering. Turmeric
paper is prepared by impregnating unsized paper with this tincture, and then drying. Both tincture and paper are used to test
for alkalies.

</p>
<p>The rhizomes contain a pigment called curcumin, an essential oil and f&aelig;cula. Curcumin (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>14</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) is crystalline, yellow by direct light and blue by reflected light; it was studied by Jackson and Menke.

</p>
<p>In the Philippines it is used extensively as a diaphoretic and emmenagogue and in icterus, intestinal colic and dysmenorrh&#339;a;
externally for skin diseases, contusions and atonic ulcers.

</p>
<p>Gubler regards it as a diffusible stimulant. Its use is more extensive in England than in France and Spain; in India it forms
an ingredient of <i>curry</i>, called <i>car&iacute;</i> in Manila. Curcumin is eliminated by the urine, which it colors yellow, and if at the same time an alkali be taken by the
patient, especially a salt of calcium, the urine becomes red and may communicate this stain to the clothes. This fact should
be borne in mind to avoid embarrassing mistakes in diagnosis or prognosis. Dose of powder, 2&#8211;5 grams.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Botanical Description</span>.&#8212;Leaves 2&#8211;4&deg; long, rising in bush-like bunches directly from the rhizome, broad-lanceolate, acuminate, gradually tapering

dyspepsia, nervous depression and spasmodic or flatulent affections of the intestine. The dose of the powdered seeds is from
0.60&#8211;1.50 grams in pill form; the tincture is, however, more convenient and is given in doses of from 4 to 8 grams.

grams every 10 minutes till vomiting occurs. Dr. W. O&#8217;Shaughnessy, writing from Bengal, states that this is the only indigenous
and abundant emetic plant of which he has experience, which acts without producing griping, purging, or other unpleasant symptoms.
In a communication to Dr. Waring he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232">232</a>]</span>remarks that it is a good emetic and diaphoretic whenever ipecacuanha is not at hand but that it should be regarded not so
much as a substitute for that article as a resource in case of need.

</p>
<p>The leaf juice is used in India to drop into the ears for disease of these organs.

</p>
<p>One of the infinite remedies used by the Filipinos under the name of &#8220;contrapoisons,&#8221; without specifying or knowing what poison,
is the powdered root of <i>Crinum</i>, given internally with a little water. They also use the leaves locally for the itch, bruising them and rubbing the affected
parts energetically with them. I may note here in passing, what I have written before: that the Filipinos have from time immemorial
been familiar with the sarcopt of scabies (Kahaw) which they pick out with a needle or spine of some fish or vegetable.

<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;This species is one of those which produce the substance known in pharmacy as <i>aloes</i>, which is the juice of the leaf evaporated to the consistency of an extract. It is official <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233">233</a>]</span>in all pharmacopoeias and its properties are known to the Filipino herb-doctors. They use the fresh juice of the leaves as
a stimulant of the scalp in baldness and locally in contusions. Aloes is a slow purgative and its irritating action on the
lower portion of the large intestine extends to the genito-urinary organs. It is, therefore, an emmenagogue and its prolonged
use causes hemorrhoids, especially in man. It is contraindicated where there is disease of the genito-urinary organs or rectum.
As it increases the secretion of bile it is useful in certain hepatic diseases. It is used in small doses as a tonic in dyspepsia.

the anus. When bruised and applied to the skin it has a counter-irritant action which makes it useful in the treatment of
rheumatism, but the odor is so disagreeable that it is not worth while to use it for that purpose when we have so many other
medicines which produce the same effect without being objectionable. It is also used locally for the bites of venomous animals.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The seeds form part of a masticatory very common throughout the extreme Orient, known as <i>Buyo</i> and composed of a betel leaf, a little slaked lime, and a slice of the fruit of the bonga, known as <i>Siri</i> in Indo-China and among the Malays. It is so common that it is hard to find a man or woman who does not use it. The saliva
of those who use it is red and of a strong odor, and its careless use in time blackens the teeth and makes the breath extremely
disagreeable. Habitual chewers consider it a tonic of the mouth and stomach and a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235">235</a>]</span>general stimulant as well. It probably does possess these properties but they are reversed in the case of persons who use
it immoderately for they lose appetite, become salivated, and the whole organism degenerates. The carbonized and powdered
fruit is used as a dentifrice but its virtues are doubtless identical with those of any vegetable charcoal, <i>i. e.</i>, absorbent and antiseptic.

</p>
<p>One unaccustomed to the use of bonga and chewing it for the first time, usually experiences a most disagreeable combination
of symptoms; constriction of the &#339;sophagus, a sensation of heat in the head and face, the latter becoming red and congested;
at the same time dizziness and precordial distress are experienced. The same phenomena occur in certain persons after eating
palmito salad or the tender central portion of the bonga and of other palms.

</p>
<p>The flowers are eaten in salad like the above-mentioned <i>palmito</i>. The seed is astringent and t&aelig;nifuge; for the latter purpose it is given internally as a powder in a dose of from 16 to 24
grams. Its action is uncertain. The catechu which is obtained in India from the Bonga differs from that obtained from the
<i>Acacia Catechu</i> and is a tonic analogous to rhatany and cinchona.

</p>
<p>The seeds contain about 14% of a fatty crystalline material which melts at 39&deg;, and after saponification yields a crystalline,
fatty acid that may be regarded as a mixture of lauric and muriatic acids. They also contain about 14% of a red, amorphous
tonic material which, after drying, is but slightly soluble in cold or hot water.

</p>
<p>The lower part of the petiole of the leaves is thin and broad, ensheathing the trunk, is as tough as pasteboard when dry and
is used in the Philippines as wrapping paper; Dr. Bholanauth Bose and other physicians of India use it as a material for splints
in fractures, a practice which might well be imitated in Manila and especially in the country.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Nom. Vulg.</span>&#8212;<i>Coco</i>, Sp.-Fil.; <i>Niog</i>, Tag.; <i>Coco-nut Palm</i>, Eng.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;This plant is, perhaps, the most useful in the Philippines. Without it and the bamboo plant the people of the Archipelago
would not know how to live. It produces vinegar, an alcoholic drink called <i>tuba</i> or <i>coco-wine</i>, an oil, an edible nut, and its leaves are used instead of nipa to roof the huts.

</p>
<p>Tuba is an opaline, slightly sweet liquid, with an agreeable taste, which rapidly becomes acid under the influence of the
heat. A flowering or fruit-bearing stalk, which has not been incised before, is chosen and encircled with several rings of
rope or rattan. The stalk is then cut and a bamboo vessel called a <i>bomb&oacute;n</i> is hung to receive the sap which escapes during the night. This liquid is valuable as a drink for those who are debilitated,
suffering from pulmonary catarrh, and even for consumptives, who are accustomed to drink it every morning, sometimes with
marvelous results, according to reports. The heat of the day rapidly ferments the tuba, converting it into a mild vinegar,
which is widely used for domestic purposes in the Philippines. When fermented and distilled it produces a weak alcohol of
disagreeable taste called coco-wine.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237">237</a>]</span></p>
<p>The ripe fruit contains a rather soft and savory meat which is generally eaten mixed with the clear, sweet coco-nut milk.
Later the meat becomes firmer and is used as a food and an oil much used in the islands is extracted from it. To extract the
oil the meat is grated and pressed until all the juice is extracted. This is called the milk and when boiled is converted
almost completely into oil. Cocoanut milk has an agreeable taste and may in some cases take the place of cow&#8217;s milk. It is
apt to produce diarrh&#339;a, however, which action may be bad for some but on the other hand good for others, such as the habitually
constipated. Both the meat and the milk are widely used by the natives in making sweets.

</p>
<p>In the greater part of the islands it is the only oil used for illumination. As a medicine it is employed internally as a
purgative and externally in the treatment of scores of troubles in which the good results obtained are due, not to the oil
but to the massage used in rubbing it in. It has the reputation of stimulating the growth of the hair and all the natives
and some Europeans use it lavishly as a hair ointment. When fresh its odor is agreeable, but it easily becomes rancid and
assumes a most disagreeable odor. In the Visayan Islands they make an oil of a nauseous odor which they call in Manila <i>Caracoa</i>. It is used only for illumination and by the poor.

</p>
<p>At a temperature of 20&deg; or more the oil remains liquid; it is colorless when fresh and properly extracted. It solidifies at
18&deg; and two kinds of soap are made of it; one soft and exceedingly cheap called &#8220;Quiapo&#8221;; the other hard, white, of a high
quality, but as a rule containing an excess of lime which in time is deposited in a fluorescent film on its surface.

</p>
<p>In India the root is employed in the treatment of dysentery.

</p>
<p><span class="smallcaps">Uses.</span>&#8212;The dry leaves of this palm are generally used in the villages of Manila Province, <span class="corr" id="xd0e12793" title="Source: Pampanag">Pampanga</span>, Bulacan and other provinces in the construction of roofs and walls of houses, which are therefore called &#8220;nipa houses.&#8221;
The decoction of the fresh leaves is used as a lotion for indolent ulcers, and a popular preserve is made from the fruit.

</p>
<p>Like the coco and following the same process the nipa yields a liquid also called tuba and possessing properties identical
with those of the former plant. The weak alcohol distilled from it has some repute in the treatment of conjunctivitis, for
which purpose a few drops are mixed with a small quantity of water and the eyes are washed with it several times a day. This
alcohol, improperly called wine of nipa, has a characteristically unpleasant odor which makes it impracticable for medicinal
or industrial use. Several chemists have attempted to remove the characteristic odor from nipa alcohol, but their results
had always been negative because the odorous principle was distilled over at the same temperature as the alcohol. Finally
a distinguished Filipino chemist, D. Anacleto del Rosario, perfected a process of producing from the nipa tuba an absolute
alcohol perfectly free from the characteristic odor; an alcohol, in fact, possessing all the qualities of chemically pure
alcohol, and of such a high grade that it was awarded the first prize at the last World&#8217;s Fair in Paris.

<p>In the Filipino therapeutics rice has an extensive use, especially in the form of a decoction called <i>cange</i>, which is commonly given in the treatment of diarrh&#339;a and dysentery, with good results. Cooked as a sort of mush it may be
used as a substitute for linseed poultices and has the great advantage of not becoming rancid. Roasted and powdered it is
dusted upon wounds or abrasions of the skin and forms a dry and absorbent covering under which they heal rapidly.

</p>
<p>It has lately been claimed that beriberi is due to a microorganism found in rice under certain abnormal conditions; this claim
is not yet firmly established and beriberi is still one of the many problems in medicine which are awaiting solution.

<p>Linn&aelig;us and Blanco include in the genus <i>Bambus</i> all the different species of bamboo to which the Spaniards have given the general name of <i>ca&ntilde;a</i>. The plant is of incomparable value to the natives of the Philippines; they build their houses of it, make agricultural and
industrial instruments of it, use it in all the varied apparatus of their fisheries and for a multitude of household utensils
and furniture.

</p>
<p>The variety <i>B. arundinacea</i>, Retz. (<i>B. arundo</i>, Blanco), <i>Kawayag-tot&oacute;o</i>, Tag., is the largest and most generally employed in making houses and furniture. The tender shoots prepared in lime water
are edible but have the deserved reputation of being difficult of digestion.

</p>
<p>The variety <i>Schizostachyum acutiflorum</i>, Munro (<i>B. diffusa</i>, Blanco), <i>Osiw</i>, <i>Bokawy</i>, Tag., is less used. The shoots are used to treat opacity of the cornea, for which purpose they are cut when about a palm
in height, the outer leaves removed, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244">244</a>]</span>and the center soaked over night with a little sugar candy. The following day the water in the bottom of the jar is collected
and used to paint the cornea.

</p>
<p>The variety <i>Dendrocalamus sericens</i>, Munro (<i>B. mitis</i>, Blanco), <i>Taywanak</i>, Tag., is also used in medicine. Its abundant sap is given internally in the treatment of phthisis.

</p>
<p>All of the above species and the <i>Dendrocalamus flagellifer</i>, Munro (<i>B. levis</i>, Blanco), <i>Boho</i>, Tag., produce at their joints a hard porcelain-like substance, friable, of opaline color, called &#8220;bamboo stone&#8221; or &#8220;tabashir&#8221;
in India, where, as well as in the Philippines and Indo-China, it has great repute among the popular remedies. It is given
in venereal diseases, hiccough, hemorrhage, fevers and other diseases. As a matter of fact, it is an almost inert substance,
the imaginary virtues of which originated, doubtless, in the apparently remarkable fact that a stone (?) was produced inside
of a vegetable.
